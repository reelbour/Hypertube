- This guy, right here!

Ah-ah. Don't be alarmed.
It is just a suit.

185
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,180
This is not my real face and body.

186
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,380
The name's Fred.

187
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,420

I am also a school mascot.

190

So, what's your major?

191
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,666
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

192
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,864
But I am a major science enthusiast.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,068
I've been trying to get
Honey to develop a formula,

194
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,190
that can turn me into a
fire-breathing lizard at will.

195
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,627
But she says that's "not science."

196
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,861
It's really not.

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

198
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,500
I asked Wasabi for
isn't "science" either.

199
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,700
- Is it?
- Nope.

200
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,585
Well, then, what about
"invisible sandwich"?

201
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,780
- TADASHI: Hiro.
- Imagine eating a sandwich,

202
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,740
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

203
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,940
Just stop.

204
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,260
- FRED: Laser eyes?
- HONEY LEMON: What?

205
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,180

- WASABI: Never gonna happen.

a growth serum, huh?

207
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,543

Hello. I am Baymax.

Your personal healthcare companion.

219
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,580
I was alerted to the need

220
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,102
for medical attention
when you said, "Ow."

221
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,422
A robotic nurse.

222
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,422
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

223
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,430
Physical or emotional?

224
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,780
I will scan you now.

Scan complete.

227
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,822
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

228
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,540
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

229

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

230
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,185
What's in the spray, specifically?

231
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,300
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

232
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,540
(CLICKS TONGUE) That's a bummer.

233
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,946
I'm actually allergic to that.

234
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,029
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

235
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,348
You do have a mild allergy to

236
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,540
peanuts.

237
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,310
Hmm. Not bad.

238
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,940
You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

239
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,144
Uh-huh. Programed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

240
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,827
This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax.

241
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,580
Vinyl?

242
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,909
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

243
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,140
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

244
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,751
- No offense.
- BAYMAX: I am a robot.

245
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,141

Hmm.

- Titanium skeleton?
- TADASHI: Carbon fiber.

250
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,388
Right. Even lighter. (GASPS)

251
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,827
Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?

252
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,540
Oh, machined them right here, in-house.

253

- Really?
- Yup.

You have been a good boy.
Have a lollipop.

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,866
Nice.

258

you are satisfied with your care.

Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

260

Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

262
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,861
Lithium ion.

263

You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

Oh, I don't know.

287

his career in bot-fighting.

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,740
Well, kind of serious.

289
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,900
I can see why.

290
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,068
With your bot, winning must come easy.

291
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,990
Yeah, I guess.

No. There's gotta be another way.
