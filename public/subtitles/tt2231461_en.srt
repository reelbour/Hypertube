Athena-1.
Athena-1, <i>come in.</i>

3
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:30,829
Athena-1, <i>this is Control. We have
negative copy on that last transmission.</i>

4
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:33,933
<i>We are showing LOS in the command module.
Please verify. Over.</i>

5
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:36,336
Mission Control,
this is Atkins.

6
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:38,338
Something went wrong
with the test.

7
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,372
The crew is dead.

8
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:42,740
<i>Athena</i> hull integrity
is critical.

9
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:44,776
I'm headed
to the escape capsule.

10
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:47,179
<i>Negative, negative.
Reroute to the lab and</i>

11
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:49,048
<i>secure the canisters
before departure.</i>

12
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,016
But the test subject is loose.

13
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:53,353
<i>Doctor, the test subject
is a rat.</i>

14
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:54,688
Not anymore.

15
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,228
What is this?

16
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,460
<i>You have your orders, Doctor.</i>

17
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:03,695
Open the goddamn door!

18
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:06,698
<i>Dr. Atkins, it's Claire Wyden.</i>

19
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,238
<i>We'll unlock the escape capsule
when you secure the samples.</i>

20
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,410
<i>Doctor, either you come home
with my research,</i>

21
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:20,215
<i>or you don't come home at all.</i>

22
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,976
Entering the lab.

23
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:56,084
Okay.

24
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:09,761
Mission Control, securing
the samples now.

25
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:10,866
<i>Copy that.</i>

26
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:28,880
<i>Warning,
hull integrity critical.</i>

27
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:35,457
Oh, God.

28
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:48,401
Open it!

29
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:50,005
<i>Capsule unlocked.</i>

30
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:28,301
Mmm. I love that smell.

31
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:30,735
Brings me right back to
Uganda.

32
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:31,937
You've been to Uganda?

33
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,605
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

34
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:36,007
If the jungle doesn't kill
you, the poachers will.

35
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,476
<i>The cops are still after me
from all that shit I pulled.</i>

36
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:40,313
<i>They call me</i> El Diablo.

37
00:05:40,315 --> 00:05:41,447
I know they don't speak Spanish,
but they might as well.

38
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,182
Right.

39
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:45,418
- You ever see <i>Blood Diamond?</i>
- Yeah.

40
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,985
Now, I know it's about diamonds,
but it really captures the vibe.

41
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:50,588
I don't know if it's the same region.
But, you know, it's intense.

42
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,192
<i>Don't mess with
Mother Africa...</i>

43
00:05:57,797 --> 00:05:59,267
Everything okay, boss?

44
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,304
No, it's not.

45
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,004
Don't move a muscle.

46
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,973
Junior here is dropping
a lot of monkey shit

47
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:11,178
with these made-up stories.

48
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:17,185
It's very entertaining, though.
It's very entertaining.

49
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:20,952
I've been to Uganda, man.

50
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:23,388
And I've been to Hogwarts.

51
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,624
Regardless, if you had any
experience with poaching,

52
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:29,660
you would know that it's extremely rude
to talk about it in front of a lady.

53
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:32,298
Oh, it's okay.
I can handle it.

54
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,137
Oh, I know you can. I'm
talking about these ladies.

55
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,557
There shouldn't be any
problems,

56
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,392
but remember you're not
in the classroom anymore.

57
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:03,528
These are wild animals.
They're very unpredictable.

58
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,533
So remember your training,
and do exactly as I say.

59
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,437
Tell me, what do you see?

60
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:15,207
The, uh, the young male,

61
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:20,444
is attempting to establish his
presence with the female.

62
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:23,383
<i>He's posturing, agitated.</i>

63
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:25,550
Sounds like someone we know,
right?

64
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:28,253
Okay, let's remember this is Paavo's
first interaction with the troop.

65
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,855
<i>So we'll just take it
nice and easy,</i>

66
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:32,594
and we'll see how well he
responds to my commands.

67
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:35,864
I...

68
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:44,406
Paavo.

69
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,773
Paavo. Paavo, it's okay.

70
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,644
Femi, Enu, on station.

71
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:53,144
<i>Good girls.</i>

72
00:07:54,782 --> 00:07:55,917
Easy.

73
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,251
That's far enough, Paavo.

74
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:01,452
It's okay.
Calm. Calm.

75
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:02,956
It's me.

76
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:09,298
Calm.

77
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:12,163
<i>There you go.</i>

78
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:13,265
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

79
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,269
<i>Good boy.</i>

80
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:19,471
Good boy.

81
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:20,941
Good boy.

82
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:30,117
Uh... Davis.

83
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:39,523
Everyone stay where you are.
No one move.

84
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,626
Are you crazy?

85
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:42,661
If you move, we're gonna be in big trouble.
Connor, do not move.

86
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:44,799
Connor, do what he says.

87
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:46,932
<i>Paavo...</i>

88
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,836
Connor, don't move!

89
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:50,869
Paavo!

90
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:52,607
No! Paavo! Shit!

91
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,341
<i>Help! Help!</i>

92
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:07,386
Connor! Connor!

93
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:08,720
It's okay.

94
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,455
George! George!

95
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,391
George!

96
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:16,029
George!
Easy, buddy. Easy.

97
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,701
Okay. Okay.

98
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:26,239
Oh, very funny. Very funny.

99
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:28,374
<i>We're all very impressed.
Yes, yes.</i>

100
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:30,208
You and I, laughing at your
joke, okay?

101
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,146
New guy, he no laugh.

102
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:34,645
He cry.

103
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:37,749
<i>Yeah. Yeah, opposite of laugh.</i>

104
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:40,018
- Connor, you can get up now.
- Are you 100% on that?

105
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,420
100% sure. You can get up.

106
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,490
And check your diaper.
Come on, let's go.

107
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:45,759
He cry.

108
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:49,528
It's okay, it's okay.

109
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,495
He's not gonna kill me?

110
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:54,057
No, he's not gonna kill you. He
has a unique sense of humor. I...

111
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,371
Uh, no, no.

112
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:01,243
George no save Davis.

113
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:04,209
I don't need your saving. No.

114
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:05,844
George no save Davis.
You didn't save me.

115
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:08,380
I was fine on my own.
I'm fine.

116
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:12,020
Stop doing that. Listen, it's important
for you to be nice to Paavo.

117
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:14,521
<i>He's just a kid.</i>

118
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,727
Poachers killed his entire
family.

119
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:23,197
<i>He's in your troop now.</i>

120
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:25,931
<i>I want you to welcome him.</i>

121
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,635
Welcome Paavo.

122
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,777
George, you and I cool?

123
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:39,546
Come on.

124
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,455
Wow, I can't,
Come on.

125
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,324
I should never have taught you
that. Stop that.

126
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:53,759
Now, come on. Give me,

127
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,094
Come on! Don't do that.

128
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:59,130
Stop that! Okay.
All right, listen.

129
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:02,069
I need you to protect Paavo.

130
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,975
Family.

131
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:22,520
I started using this new
vegan deodorant.

132
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,822
- How's that?
- I smell like guacamole.

133
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:27,293
Hey! Davis.

134
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:28,493
Hey.

135
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:31,297
Hi. Look,
I just wanted to say,

136
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,631
that was amazing out there.

137
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,700
Ah, thank you.

138
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:38,669
And I would love to learn more
about those submission techniques.

139
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,641
If you have time for a drink?

140
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,042
Yes!

141
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:45,509
Your allergies acting up
again?

142
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:46,677
It's the dander.

143
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,280
- It's the dander.
- <i>Animal dander.</i>

144
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:49,815
Mmm-hmm. Uh...

145
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,217
Thank you, anyway.
I appreciate it.

146
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:52,551
I already have plans tonight.

147
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:53,552
You did great out there today.
Okay?

148
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,519
Oh, I didn't do anything.

149
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,188
Exactly. The first rule of
dealing with hostile animals is,

150
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,358
you wanna remain calm.

151
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,395
I was gonna bake some kale bread
tonight, if you're interested.

152
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:07,299
No, I know you have a gluten thing.
All right, see you in the morning.

153
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,801
She used the word
"submission." That's a clue.

154
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:12,003
Should I go back there and tell her your
plans are to hang out with your dogs?

155
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:15,408
Come on, you know me, Nelson.
I need my "me" time.

156
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,042
Your "me" time?

157
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:19,177
Okay. Listen, buddy,

158
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:21,291
since everyone else is afraid to
tell you this, of course I will.

159
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:22,417
It's, um...

160
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,351
Uh, what's the terminology?

161
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,357
Weird you like hanging out
with animals more than people.

162
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:31,188
They get me.

163
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,023
Animals like you, they lick you.
They don't like you, they eat you.

164
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:35,059
You always know where you
stand.

165
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,230
Or where you lie. All chewed up in
their belly 'cause they ate you.

166
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:39,730
Yeah, that's just some food for thought.
And by the way, you're the food.

167
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:41,932
All right, get outta here,
you big lug.

168
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:43,236
Say hi to the dogs for me.

169
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,605
I will.

170
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,881
Girls love him.

171
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:57,352
I should shave my head.

172
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:24,668
I got your message about
George. He okay?

173
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,804
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

174
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:28,041
Davis. Davis!

175
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,978
He's in the grizzly enclosure.

176
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:34,682
What?

177
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:51,531
Jesus.

178
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:05,310
- Put it down.
- What?

179
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:07,077
You know how he is around guns.
Put it down.

180
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,380
Are you sure?

181
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,584
Put it down.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

182
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:22,331
Hey, George?

183
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:24,865
It's okay.

184
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:26,733
It's me.

185
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:29,937
It's me.

186
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,045
What happened?

187
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:42,681
You're sad.

188
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:44,386
It's okay.

189
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,521
Did you hurt him?

190
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:50,757
"Sorry"?

191
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,893
It's okay.

192
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,869
Did he hurt you?

193
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:06,307
He made you scared.

194
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,642
It's okay.

195
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:11,144
It's...

196
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:14,548
George.

197
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:16,417
George.

198
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:19,250
It's okay to be scared.

199
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:21,488
It's okay.
Calm.

200
00:16:24,257 --> 00:16:25,393
Easy.

201
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:38,270
Is it me or is he
considerably bigger?

202
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:40,605
No, he's definitely bigger.

203
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:42,341
<i>It's Connor.</i>

204
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:44,383
<i>Guys, you need to get over
to the gorilla enclosure.</i>

205
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,190
What the hell happened?

206
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,259
We were doing our morning
rounds when we saw the burnt foliage,

207
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:02,527
and found this.

208
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,030
All right, let me see the kit.

209
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:22,213
What is it?

210
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:25,485
I don't know.
But we gotta figure it out.

211
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:30,521
<i>Stupid piece of crap!</i>

212
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,025
<i>Mini space station!</i>

213
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:35,963
Are you done?

214
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:40,164
We just lost billions of
dollars, Claire.

215
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,865
Tens of billions, actually.

216
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,969
Plus $20,000 for the models
you just destroyed.

217
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:46,874
Our stock got hammered this
morning.

218
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,873
Down 20%.

219
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,842
And you aren't upset,
because...

220
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:53,678
Because Project Rampage works.

221
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,181
- Do you know how much that's worth?
- Zero.

222
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:59,417
Because all of our research
was on that space station.

223
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:01,054
Actually,

224
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:05,257
Atkins got the research
samples onto the escape pod.

225
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:07,326
<i>Yes, the escape pod blew up.</i>

226
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:10,662
But the canisters were
engineered to withstand reentry.

227
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:13,264
And the American Meteor Society
just reported a meteor strike

228
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,865
in southern Wyoming.

229
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:18,903
All we have to do is go
get it back.

230
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:20,704
Well, let's get out there!

231
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:23,375
Somebody finds that sample,
it leads straight back to us.

232
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:25,576
Please, enough with the
overreacting.

233
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:27,378
I am not overreacting, Claire.

234
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,713
There's a reason we were doing
these experiments in space.

235
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:31,795
And it wasn't exactly for
the betterment of humanity.

236
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:33,718
Okay.

237
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,586
Look,

238
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:37,222
you handle the press,

239
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:39,391
and I'll get Burke to take
care of the canister.

240
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:41,359
Who is Burke?

241
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,362
Remember that private military
firm we acquired last year?

242
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:45,195
You called them "Killers
'R' Us."

243
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:47,598
Yeah?

244
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,736
Well, he's the "us."

245
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,325
Boss.

246
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:15,496
<i>Wheels up! You boys are
Oscar Mike.</i>

247
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:17,463
Let's do it.

248
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:30,807
<i>Where to, Burke?</i>

249
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:31,976
<i>Wyoming.</i>

250
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:33,443
<i>Ah, never been.</i>

251
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:35,512
<i>Lots of mountains,
not a lot of people.</i>

252
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:38,084
<i>Animals love it.
You'll fit right in.</i>

253
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:06,644
Shit.

254
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:08,680
Hey, Mark.

255
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:10,448
<i>Where the hell are you? Do you
have any idea what time it is?</i>

256
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,819
Yes, yes. Um...

257
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:14,152
Yeah, sorry.

258
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:16,656
I am on the freeway,

259
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:22,160
I know I've already been late
twice this week,

260
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:24,494
but it will not happen again.

261
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:27,131
<i>Brett Wyden addressed the
situation with this brief statement.</i>

262
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:30,368
<i>My sister and I and everyone at
Energyne are stunned and deeply saddened</i>

263
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,304
<i>by the loss of the</i> Athena-1
<i>crew.</i>

264
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,672
<i>These were brave and brilliant
men and women of science,</i>

265
00:20:34,674 --> 00:20:36,740
<i>who were committed to helping
mankind,</i>

266
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:38,710
<i>and we will continue that work
in their honor.</i>

267
00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:39,911
<i>That's enough.
Thank you.</i>

268
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:43,580
Helping mankind, my ass.

269
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:47,518
<i>Since then, Wall Street has kept a
close eye on Energyne's performance.</i>

270
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,886
<i>Now to politics...</i>

271
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:52,257
<i>What you're looking at is
dramatic video of a fireball</i>

272
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,192
<i>touching down near the San
Diego Wildlife Sanctuary.</i>

273
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:58,863
<i>It is thought to be debris from
last night's</i> Athena-1 <i>tragedy.</i>

274
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:00,597
<i>However, it's unclear
if this is related</i>

275
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,000
<i>to one of the park's gorillas
escaping the enclosure</i>

276
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:04,434
<i>at the sanctuary earlier
this morning.</i>

277
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:06,170
<i>The gorilla's name is
George...</i>

278
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:09,173
Hold on a second, Mark.
The car ahead of me...

279
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:11,875
- It just exploded.
- <i>What?</i>

280
00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:14,846
<i>There is currently no explanation
for the primate's behavior,</i>

281
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:17,249
<i>and zoo officials are not
commenting at this time.</i>

282
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:20,451
<i>Our very own Jason Sloss is at
the scene. Jason, what have you heard?</i>

283
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,086
<i>That's right,
Chris and Maria.</i>

284
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:23,554
<i>I'm here at the San Diego
Wildlife Sanctuary,</i>

285
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:25,289
<i>and the word
everyone seems to be using</i>

286
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,396
<i>to describe the gorilla's
escape is "surprising."</i>

287
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:42,277
<i>There. Set her down.</i>

288
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:10,167
<i>We've secured the canister, but
it was pretty badly damaged.</i>

289
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:12,804
<i>Whatever was in it
was destroyed.</i>

290
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:13,941
<i>There's something else.</i>

291
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:17,442
<i>These wolves were slaughtered.</i>

292
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:21,245
<i>From the tracks, looks like
another one killed the pack.</i>

293
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:22,915
It's infected with the
pathogen.

294
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:28,118
Burke, I need that wolf.
Dead or alive.

295
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,922
<i>Copy that.</i>

296
00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:36,629
This is the list of the unrecognized
hybrids you were talking about.

297
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:41,366
George's lab results are in.

298
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:43,036
You're not gonna like 'em.

299
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:47,971
This can't be right.

300
00:22:47,973 --> 00:22:50,275
His neuromuscular synapse
activity is through the roof,

301
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:54,010
his blood has lethal
concentrations of growth hormone,

302
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:55,480
he'd be dead.

303
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:56,646
Run it again.

304
00:22:56,648 --> 00:22:58,317
I did.

305
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,118
I ran it three times.
His values went up each time.

306
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,787
We can't keep this quiet.

307
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:04,689
Animal Response is
asking questions.

308
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:06,325
I just dodged a call. It was
someone from the government.

309
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:07,791
What do you want me to tell
people?

310
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,626
Tell them nothing.

311
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:10,894
He didn't do it, Nelson.

312
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:12,364
Look at him.
Somebody did that to him.

313
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:15,532
Davis, he killed
a grizzly bear.

314
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:17,801
Okay? Snapped his neck
like it was a toothpick.

315
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:20,637
Listen, protocol says, first sign of
aggression mandates immediate isolation.

316
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:21,873
It's what we're doing.

317
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,174
This is beyond protocol.

318
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:26,411
Davis, look at him.

319
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:28,682
- I'm looking at him.
- Really look at him!

320
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:33,687
That is not the George we know.

321
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:39,426
If we report this,
they're gonna put him down.

322
00:23:42,194 --> 00:23:44,098
I can't let that happen.

323
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:52,936
I'll keep everyone off your
back as long as I can.

324
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:54,107
All right.

325
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:56,042
Thank you.

326
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,796
I'm gonna figure this out,
George.

327
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:21,201
I promise.

328
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:28,038
All right, everybody,
listen up.

329
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,474
I need to find someone who knows
exactly what the hell this thing is.

330
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:32,977
I found her!

331
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:34,979
No, that's a lie.
Technically, she found us.

332
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:37,114
You must be Davis Okoye.

333
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:39,616
Thank you so much for
your help.

334
00:24:39,618 --> 00:24:41,319
What help?

335
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:43,820
I'm Kate Caldwell. I'm a
geneticist with Energyne.

336
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:46,490
Um, you recovered
my research sample.

337
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,593
Yeah, you mean this?

338
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:51,729
Oh, please tell me you had that
tested for residual particulates.

339
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:54,097
Yes, that's exactly what I did.
I always do that.

340
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,665
Anytime something
new comes in.

341
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,602
Amy, have this tested
for residual particulates.

342
00:24:57,604 --> 00:24:59,069
I need that back.

343
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:01,505
Actually, I need some
questions answered.

344
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:04,308
Like what the hell is that
thing doing to my friend?

345
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:08,112
Uh, well, I am not allowed
to discuss that with you.

346
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:10,580
Oh. Okay, well,

347
00:25:10,582 --> 00:25:12,583
I guess we can't help each
other then.

348
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:14,751
Kate Caldwell, it was good to meet you.
Nelson, show her out.

349
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:16,088
He's growing, isn't he?

350
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:20,090
At an unprecedented rate,
right?

351
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:24,127
Increased strength, speed,
agility.

352
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:27,867
Demonstrating levels of aggression
you don't see in his species.

353
00:25:31,204 --> 00:25:32,705
Come with me.

354
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:41,444
Last night, he was seven feet,
500 pounds.

355
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:44,218
This morning, he was almost
nine feet, pushing 1,000.

356
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,484
His hair?

357
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:49,452
Yeah, he's an albino.

358
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:51,774
As far as I know, he's the only
living gorilla of his kind.

359
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,460
He can sign?

360
00:25:56,462 --> 00:25:57,862
Yeah, he can sign
and he's hungry.

361
00:25:57,864 --> 00:25:59,462
Guys, let's get George
something to eat.

362
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:01,635
It's okay.
There you go, buddy.

363
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:04,535
It makes sense.

364
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:05,869
He must be starving.

365
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:07,805
He's growing so rapidly.

366
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:09,340
"Makes sense"?

367
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:11,041
Last night, he killed
a grizzly bear.

368
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:12,977
The most powerful terrestrial
predator on the planet.

369
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:15,512
So you tell me right now, Kate,
how any of this makes sense.

370
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:17,348
Are you familiar with CRISPR?

371
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,649
Yeah, genetic engineering.

372
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,318
It's more like
genetic editing.

373
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,321
I am talking about
extremely specific results.

374
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:25,021
Check this out.

375
00:26:25,023 --> 00:26:27,525
Sharks are indeterminate
growers, right?

376
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:28,858
They never stop.

377
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,028
Isolate that gene
and combine it with, say,

378
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,029
the growth rate of a
blue whale,

379
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:34,865
the strength of a
rhinoceros beetle,

380
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,834
the speed of a cheetah,

381
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:39,270
And you get one confused gorilla
that could take down a grizzly.

382
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:42,206
We developed a lot of different
genetic combinations,

383
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:45,608
so changes will be incredibly
unpredictable.

384
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,577
<i>Right. Okay,
Kate, I get all that,</i>

385
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,747
but it still doesn't explain
to me how he doubled in size.

386
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:51,449
Guys, we need to get that
food in now.

387
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:53,951
See, CRISPR only allows
you to alter

388
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:56,253
the DNA of one cell at a time.

389
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:58,423
But I developed a system

390
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:03,626
which rapidly transmits changes to every
strand of DNA in the host's body.

391
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:05,762
Mr. Okoye, listen to me.

392
00:27:05,764 --> 00:27:09,066
I am the only one
who can cure him.

393
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:12,438
George!

394
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:17,577
George! No!

395
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:25,786
It's not gonna hold.

396
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:27,453
Kate!

397
00:27:31,723 --> 00:27:33,159
Everybody back!

398
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:44,838
Not again! Not again!

399
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:48,172
George!

400
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:50,807
George! Stop, George!

401
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:51,811
<i>Davis!</i>

402
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,312
Shit.
Call 911!

403
00:27:55,314 --> 00:27:56,615
Come on!

404
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,150
Look out!

405
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,702
George! George!

406
00:28:19,704 --> 00:28:21,939
George, it's okay.
It's okay.

407
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:23,473
It's okay.

408
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:26,042
Yes, I know you're scared.
I'm gonna help you.

409
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:30,883
No, no, no.

410
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:34,184
No, it's okay.

411
00:28:34,186 --> 00:28:35,553
Sir, move away from the
animal!

412
00:28:35,555 --> 00:28:37,289
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

413
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,856
I'm the primatologist here.
I look after this animal.

414
00:28:39,858 --> 00:28:42,795
I can handle this situation. I just
need you to lower your weapons.

415
00:28:43,362 --> 00:28:44,364
Please.

416
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,202
It's okay. Calm.

417
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:51,003
Good.

418
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:55,708
Stand down.

419
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,145
Stand down.

420
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:01,814
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm gonna help you.

421
00:29:05,518 --> 00:29:06,586
What the hell?

422
00:29:09,388 --> 00:29:10,390
No!

423
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:16,230
George!

424
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:43,123
George!

425
00:29:43,723 --> 00:29:45,090
George!

426
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:47,794
George!

427
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:01,605
<i>I've never hunted a wolf before.
What do you think, fellas?</i>

428
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:03,443
<i>Should I bring the .50 cal?</i>

429
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,813
<i>Got 'em.
Treeline.</i>

430
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:13,318
<i>You sure that's a wolf?
Damn, that thing is moving.</i>

431
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,820
<i>Not for long.</i>

432
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:34,306
<i>Burke to Base,</i>

433
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:36,809
<i>Rampage-1 is down.</i>

434
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,347
What do you got?

435
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:17,149
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

436
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:20,986
Wait a second.

437
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:25,455
<i>We got tracks.</i>

438
00:31:25,457 --> 00:31:26,992
<i>Are you seeing this?</i>

439
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:34,568
Jesus.

440
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,002
A wolf made that?

441
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:41,375
Maybe I should've
brought the .50 cal.

442
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:58,358
Boss...

443
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,494
How we playing this?

444
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:05,831
Nice and easy.

445
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:17,241
They're in a hurry.

446
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:18,378
What do you think spooked...

447
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:22,846
Vinny! Garrick!
Set a perimeter!

448
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:24,448
- Come on!
- Open fire!

449
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,384
<i>Get it! Get it!</i>

450
00:32:26,386 --> 00:32:27,621
<i>Light him up!</i>

451
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,855
What the hell?

452
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:34,057
<i>Hit 'em! Hit 'em!</i>

453
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:36,026
<i>Run! Run!</i>

454
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:37,560
<i>Garrick, where are you?</i>

455
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:39,898
<i>- It's on me!
- Run, Garrick!</i>

456
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,633
Come on, get it!

457
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:43,967
<i>Taylor, get up!</i>

458
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:45,068
They won't.

459
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,636
<i>Taylor! Go!</i>

460
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:48,806
The pathogen is doing what
we designed it to.

461
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:50,609
<i>No! God damn it!</i>

462
00:32:56,383 --> 00:32:58,084
Wilson, check in.

463
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:00,587
Zammit, check in.

464
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:03,957
Taylor...

465
00:33:31,983 --> 00:33:33,283
Garcia, get me outta here.

466
00:33:33,285 --> 00:33:34,687
<i>Copy that. Ten klicks out.</i>

467
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:46,930
<i>Oh, shit! I see him!</i>

468
00:33:46,932 --> 00:33:48,635
Light him up!

469
00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:55,841
Incoming!

470
00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:00,009
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

471
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:02,011
<i>Oh, no!</i>

472
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:04,050
<i>I'm losing control!</i>

473
00:35:00,705 --> 00:35:02,008
Sir, let's go.

474
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,348
Out of the van, please.

475
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:23,028
Who the hell is this?

476
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:35,642
Mr. Okoye and Dr. Caldwell.

477
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:39,609
I am Agent Harvey Russell.

478
00:35:39,611 --> 00:35:41,444
Hell of a day, huh?

479
00:35:41,446 --> 00:35:44,215
Science experiments
falling from the sky.

480
00:35:44,217 --> 00:35:46,416
Giant gorilla on the loose.

481
00:35:46,418 --> 00:35:49,553
Just the kind of exciting shit we here
at the government tend to notice.

482
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:51,988
Where's George? I need to
see him.

483
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,957
And if you're thinking about putting him on
that plane, it's gonna be a big mistake.

484
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,662
I think we'll be all right.

485
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,765
Okay, let's all take a
breath and...

486
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,834
I said I wanna see George.

487
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:07,004
Or we can get in each other's
faces and see who's the toughest.

488
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:09,805
Brother, I'm gonna prance
myself right out on a limb,

489
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:13,776
and guess that no one's ever accused
you of being a people person.

490
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:17,915
How about you take these cuffs
off and find out yourself?

491
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:19,185
Brother.

492
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:25,022
I'll see you on board.

493
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:27,026
Load 'em up with the ape.

494
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:31,264
So weird that he didn't take
your cuffs off.

495
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:46,011
- He's good.
- All right.

496
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:49,448
Just note it in the chart.

497
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:53,116
You see that?

498
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:56,053
Where he cut himself breaking
out of the primate department.

499
00:36:56,055 --> 00:36:57,988
There's barely a bruise now.

500
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,823
African spiny mouse.

501
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:04,696
Its DNA makes it capable
of extreme regeneration.

502
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:10,566
"Davis Okoye,
Primate Specialist."

503
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:12,238
Blah, blah, blah.

504
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:16,573
Army Special Forces.

505
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:19,176
What are you, some kind of
international man of mystery?

506
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:23,714
I see a lot of "redacted."
"Redacted, redacted..."

507
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:25,881
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

508
00:37:25,883 --> 00:37:29,919
"Transferred to the United Nations'
Special Anti-Poaching Task Force."

509
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:32,522
Well, I'll have you know that I,
myself, am also an animal lover.

510
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:34,191
Let's cut the bullshit,
Russell.

511
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:36,026
I told you, having George
on this airplane is suicidal.

512
00:37:36,028 --> 00:37:37,894
He's on a very powerful
sedative drip.

513
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:41,031
He will not wake up until we
wake him up.

514
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:44,000
Sir, with all due respect,
at his rate of growth,

515
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:47,371
that sedative is gonna become ineffective
long before we're back on the ground.

516
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:50,407
We factored in his growth rate.
Same as his elevated metabolism.

517
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,409
- Sir.
- And the increased amount of blood,

518
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:55,678
in his system. We may not be the
brightest bulbs in the room,

519
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,613
but we're doing all right.

520
00:37:57,615 --> 00:37:59,950
<i>Especially considering,</i>

521
00:37:59,952 --> 00:38:03,020
you got another one of your little science
experiments running around out there.

522
00:38:03,022 --> 00:38:04,453
What do you mean another one?

523
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:06,622
Oh, you didn't know about
the 30-foot wolf?

524
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:08,924
Oh, sir,

525
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:11,930
your oversized monkey
is old news.

526
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:14,698
Jesus.

527
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,302
Weirdos on the Internet
are calling him "Ralph."

528
00:38:18,304 --> 00:38:19,870
Who do you work for?

529
00:38:19,872 --> 00:38:21,872
Sir, I work for the American
people.

530
00:38:21,874 --> 00:38:23,443
Homeland? CIA?

531
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:27,076
Justice League?

532
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:28,979
I'm OGA.

533
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:31,982
I've heard that bullshit before.
"Other Government Agency," huh?

534
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:33,149
It's clever.

535
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:35,219
Yes, sir, it is clever.

536
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:38,221
You see, when science
shits the bed,

537
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:40,557
I'm the guy they call
to change the sheets.

538
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,591
What's gonna happen to George?

539
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:44,961
He didn't ask for any of this. He
sure as hell doesn't deserve it.

540
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:48,932
Whether it is his fault or
not, he is dangerous.

541
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:51,402
But there's a cure for this.

542
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:53,904
She helped engineer the
pathogen that infected George.

543
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:56,306
She works for Energyne.

544
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:58,443
You mean used to.

545
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:08,919
"Dr. Kate Caldwell. Ph.D. in
Biochemistry from Stanford,

546
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:11,854
"with a specialty
in Conservation Genetics."

547
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:15,694
Recruited by Energyne in 2010.

548
00:39:17,428 --> 00:39:19,629
Fired by Energyne,

549
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:21,533
<i>a little less than two
years ago.</i>

550
00:39:22,335 --> 00:39:23,966
It gets better.

551
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:26,970
Caught trying to steal
company hard drives,

552
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:29,273
and did 13, what I'm sure
were glorious months,

553
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:33,313
in our beautiful Greenville
Federal Correctional Institute.

554
00:39:36,147 --> 00:39:41,183
Well, I am guessing by the
look on the big fella's face

555
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:42,854
that this is all news to him.

556
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:47,957
Enjoy your flight.

557
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:51,397
Oh. Mr. Okoye,
about your friend.

558
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,633
For what it's worth,

559
00:39:55,968 --> 00:39:58,071
I am truly sorry.

560
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,317
I'm sorry I lied to you.

561
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:15,185
Can you cure George or not?

562
00:40:15,187 --> 00:40:18,087
I know that Energyne was working on
a counter-measure to the pathogen,

563
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:19,658
Yes or no?

564
00:40:23,162 --> 00:40:24,763
No.

565
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:36,772
<i>Claire, I found him.</i>

566
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:38,741
Some black ops-looking dudes
loaded the gorilla,

567
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:42,745
into a cargo plane late last night.
You know who that is with them?

568
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:45,048
No. But clearly, he likes
hitting the gym.

569
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,551
No. The woman.

570
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:50,122
It's Kate Caldwell.

571
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:52,589
Dr. Caldwell.

572
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:55,591
Yeah. What's she doing
out there?

573
00:40:55,593 --> 00:40:58,861
Well, given our history
with her,

574
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:02,866
her blaming us for putting her in
prison and the death of her brother,

575
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:07,102
my best guess? Gathering
evidence to screw us over.

576
00:41:07,104 --> 00:41:09,705
I told you, we should've
liquidated her two years ago.

577
00:41:09,707 --> 00:41:11,908
Claire, you can't liquidate
every problem you have.

578
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,277
Agree to disagree.

579
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:15,611
Claire, I'm serious! Hey!

580
00:41:15,613 --> 00:41:17,280
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

581
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:19,282
but I don't even care
about the money anymore, okay?

582
00:41:19,284 --> 00:41:20,750
I just don't want
to go to prison.

583
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:23,118
So if you have a plan,
I would love to hear it.

584
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,992
Brett, I always have a plan.

585
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:34,096
If you've given a subject
extraordinary genetic gifts,

586
00:41:34,098 --> 00:41:36,933
and unlimited physical potential
combined with unthinkable violent,

587
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:39,769
and aggressive disposition,
how do you control it?

588
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:41,937
I don't know,
you give it a chill pill or...

589
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:44,107
Yes. See?
That wasn't so hard.

590
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:45,575
Yes!

591
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:48,411
R-19, the chill pill.
One small dose will stop

592
00:41:48,413 --> 00:41:50,680
an infected creature's
growth and aggression.

593
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:54,618
And to draw them here, the pathogen
also genetically rewired the subject

594
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,187
to respond to a low
frequency radio wave.

595
00:41:57,189 --> 00:41:59,455
Lucky for us,

596
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:02,293
this building has some of the most
powerful radio antennas in the world.

597
00:42:02,295 --> 00:42:05,264
I had our team modify
this one last night.

598
00:42:16,342 --> 00:42:18,674
Now, we just have to
turn on the signal.

599
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:20,944
And those creatures will
do anything to get here

600
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:22,544
and make it stop.

601
00:42:22,546 --> 00:42:25,147
How do you think that will
go over at 32,000 feet?

602
00:42:25,149 --> 00:42:27,183
That monkey will bring the
whole plane down.

603
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:29,551
And when the wolf gets here,
we let the military kill it,

604
00:42:29,553 --> 00:42:32,187
and then we collect a sample
of the weaponized DNA.

605
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:34,293
Then we sell that shit
for a mint!

606
00:42:39,897 --> 00:42:41,368
Wow.

607
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:37,689
George, you okay, buddy?

608
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:57,411
Oh, no.

609
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:05,117
Get up. Now!

610
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:13,259
<i>Caution. Caution. Caution.</i>

611
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:21,830
Aim for his body!

612
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:23,135
Light him up!

613
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,638
Get back!

614
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:42,852
Come on, come on!

615
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:43,989
Strap in.

616
00:45:00,504 --> 00:45:02,274
6-1-2-Heavy,
mayday, mayday!

617
00:45:06,778 --> 00:45:08,215
Shit. Shit.

618
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:28,134
George.

619
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:53,525
Oh, shit!

620
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:23,955
Hold on!

621
00:46:30,461 --> 00:46:31,463
Davis!

622
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,299
<i>Hurry!</i>

623
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:47,109
Davis!

624
00:46:47,111 --> 00:46:48,546
Swing me!

625
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:05,265
Now what?

626
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:14,607
We're getting the hell off
this plane!

627
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:28,355
Hang on tight!

628
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,968
This is insane!
We're gonna die!

629
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:46,202
Probably!

630
00:47:46,204 --> 00:47:47,506
Now go!

631
00:48:15,368 --> 00:48:16,402
God damn it, Russell!

632
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,852
Holy shit!

633
00:48:35,854 --> 00:48:37,489
You're welcome!

634
00:48:59,611 --> 00:49:01,348
I'm sorry, George.

635
00:49:30,475 --> 00:49:32,144
Where's the body?

636
00:49:39,384 --> 00:49:40,985
There isn't one.

637
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:44,890
He's wounded but he survived.

638
00:49:48,226 --> 00:49:49,827
Tracks are headed northeast.

639
00:49:50,894 --> 00:49:52,627
And I got zero signal.

640
00:49:52,629 --> 00:49:55,163
I'm gonna see if I can find
a radio, get it working.

641
00:49:55,165 --> 00:49:59,402
Once DoD figures out your
animal survived that crash,

642
00:49:59,404 --> 00:50:01,304
they're gonna have questions
for you two.

643
00:50:01,306 --> 00:50:03,138
What about Energyne?

644
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,475
They know a hell of a lot more
about this than we do.

645
00:50:05,477 --> 00:50:08,244
Yeah, the FBI's checking on
Energyne.

646
00:50:08,246 --> 00:50:09,847
Listen, do me a favor,

647
00:50:10,981 --> 00:50:13,017
don't meander off too far.

648
00:50:14,151 --> 00:50:16,185
Oh, Mr. Okoye.

649
00:50:16,187 --> 00:50:18,754
Yeah.

650
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:22,291
Thank you for getting this
old cowboy off that plane.

651
00:50:22,293 --> 00:50:24,495
Well, even assholes deserve
a second chance.

652
00:50:27,031 --> 00:50:29,799
Like my grandpappy
always said,

653
00:50:29,801 --> 00:50:32,104
us assholes gotta stick
together.

654
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:37,774
Have you seen our
satellite footage?

655
00:50:37,776 --> 00:50:39,478
The gorilla survived
the crash!

656
00:50:40,279 --> 00:50:42,611
Yes.

657
00:50:42,613 --> 00:50:45,215
Unfortunately,
so did Dr. Caldwell.

658
00:50:45,217 --> 00:50:47,051
So now what?

659
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,120
The gorilla doesn't
concern me.

660
00:50:51,122 --> 00:50:53,855
It'll respond to the radio
frequency and come straight to us.

661
00:50:53,857 --> 00:50:56,293
Dr. Caldwell is the bigger
problem.

662
00:50:56,295 --> 00:50:57,963
Do you think she told them
something?

663
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:04,333
Based on the federal agents who are
about to walk through our door,

664
00:51:04,335 --> 00:51:06,836
I'd say she told them
everything.

665
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:07,973
What?

666
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:17,213
Ah...

667
00:51:17,215 --> 00:51:19,215
Claire Wyden.
How may I be of assistance?

668
00:51:19,217 --> 00:51:21,183
Agent Park, FBI.

669
00:51:21,185 --> 00:51:23,685
This is a warrant for a complete
search of your company's records,

670
00:51:23,687 --> 00:51:25,187
starting with your lab.

671
00:51:25,189 --> 00:51:27,024
Of course. Follow me.

672
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:34,897
We are horrified that what's happening
out there originated in this lab,

673
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:37,201
and we will do anything we
can to help.

674
00:51:37,203 --> 00:51:39,502
Good, we need access to
everything.

675
00:51:39,504 --> 00:51:42,171
Absolutely.
You have our full cooperation.

676
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:43,506
Every file.

677
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:46,908
Hard drives and servers, too.
Let's go.

678
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,845
Step away from
your work station, sir.

679
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:51,248
Could you open that up?
Keep yourself logged in.

680
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,049
Step back.

681
00:51:53,051 --> 00:51:55,183
To that end, Agent Park, we're
going through the files

682
00:51:55,185 --> 00:51:58,355
of the scientist responsible for
these creatures, Dr. Kate Caldwell.

683
00:51:58,357 --> 00:52:01,122
I'm sure you're aware
of her criminal record.

684
00:52:01,124 --> 00:52:03,226
Unfortunately,
we're just now uncovering

685
00:52:03,228 --> 00:52:06,428
all the horrible things she was
doing during her time here.

686
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,364
I'll need that list of
Energyne servers, ASAP.

687
00:52:08,366 --> 00:52:09,634
Of course, sir.

688
00:52:16,908 --> 00:52:17,910
You okay?

689
00:52:19,277 --> 00:52:21,776
Because you're sweating.
A lot.

690
00:52:21,778 --> 00:52:23,044
No, I'm fine.

691
00:52:23,046 --> 00:52:24,982
Everything's fine.

692
00:52:27,386 --> 00:52:29,886
Whiskey-Two-Tango,
Whiskey-Two-Tango,

693
00:52:29,888 --> 00:52:33,322
this is Echo-Four-Romeo, over.

694
00:52:33,324 --> 00:52:36,491
<i>Whiskey-Two-Tango,
Whiskey-Two-Tango,</i>

695
00:52:36,493 --> 00:52:38,995
<i>this is Echo-Four-Romeo.</i>

696
00:52:38,997 --> 00:52:41,433
So, what do we do now?

697
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,567
I'm sorry, Doc.

698
00:52:45,569 --> 00:52:47,569
There's no "we" anymore.

699
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:51,439
Look, I am sorry
I lied to you.

700
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:53,342
Yeah, save it.

701
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:55,944
You wanted something, you lied to get it.
You're human.

702
00:52:55,946 --> 00:52:58,149
What makes you dislike
people so much?

703
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:05,787
Let me tell you something.

704
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:08,591
I've fought in wars all
over the world.

705
00:53:08,593 --> 00:53:12,861
Hunted down animal poachers,
Africa, India, South America.

706
00:53:12,863 --> 00:53:16,165
I got to see how people
really are.

707
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:18,703
And they'll pretty much do
anything to get what they want.

708
00:53:20,437 --> 00:53:22,441
You think we're all like that?

709
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:26,345
You know where I found George?

710
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:30,648
<i>He was hiding underneath
the poacher's truck.</i>

711
00:53:33,284 --> 00:53:35,351
<i>When my team arrived,</i>

712
00:53:35,353 --> 00:53:39,288
<i>these bastards were in the
middle of butchering his mother.</i>

713
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:43,792
<i>They were cutting off her hands so
they could sell them as ashtrays.</i>

714
00:53:43,794 --> 00:53:45,995
<i>George never would've survived
on his own.</i>

715
00:53:45,997 --> 00:53:49,067
<i>An albino like that on the black
market is worth a fortune.</i>

716
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:52,170
So I took him with me.

717
00:53:55,138 --> 00:53:56,908
And what happened
to the poachers?

718
00:53:58,377 --> 00:54:01,680
Well, they shot at us
and they missed.

719
00:54:02,479 --> 00:54:04,015
I shot back.

720
00:54:04,749 --> 00:54:05,884
I didn't.

721
00:54:33,212 --> 00:54:36,781
It's a good thing George doesn't
feel the same way about people.

722
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,284
What's that supposed to mean?

723
00:54:41,286 --> 00:54:43,387
Oh. After what happened
to his family,

724
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:46,058
it feels like it would be real
easy for him not to trust humans,

725
00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:49,627
but he definitely trusts you.

726
00:54:51,129 --> 00:54:53,095
Right?

727
00:54:53,097 --> 00:54:55,631
You're a geneticist,
you're not a shrink.

728
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:59,901
I also have a Ph.D. in calling
people on their shit.

729
00:54:59,903 --> 00:55:02,937
Ah, well.
This ought to be good then.

730
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:06,441
Look, after college,
I was using CRISPR

731
00:55:06,443 --> 00:55:08,779
to help endangered species
in the Arctic.

732
00:55:09,981 --> 00:55:12,881
Then my brother got sick.

733
00:55:12,883 --> 00:55:15,884
Doctors told him he didn't
have much of a chance.

734
00:55:15,886 --> 00:55:17,589
But I knew CRISPR
could save him.

735
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:22,259
Then Claire Wyden showed up.

736
00:55:22,261 --> 00:55:25,593
She made me her lead
genetic researcher.

737
00:55:25,595 --> 00:55:28,264
- So Energyne recruited you?
- Yeah.

738
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:30,300
But what I didn't
know was that

739
00:55:30,302 --> 00:55:32,167
every time I'd make a breakthrough
that could help my brother,

740
00:55:32,169 --> 00:55:34,939
they were secretly using it
to build weaponized DNA.

741
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:39,477
I tried to destroy it.

742
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:43,848
Security just got to me
before I could finish the job.

743
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:49,286
Anyway, uh,

744
00:55:49,288 --> 00:55:52,491
a month after I went
to prison, my brother died.

745
00:55:56,861 --> 00:55:59,196
I never even got to say
goodbye.

746
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:03,935
I'm sorry.

747
00:56:05,337 --> 00:56:07,169
I just wanna make sure

748
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:10,809
the Wydens can't hurt anyone
or anything ever again.

749
00:56:13,044 --> 00:56:14,713
Does that sound like a plan?

750
00:56:16,847 --> 00:56:18,283
Sounds like a plan.

751
00:56:24,888 --> 00:56:27,124
Looks like our ride's here.

752
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:40,739
<i>...Captain Evans.</i>

753
00:56:44,342 --> 00:56:46,242
<i>Copy that.
Set a perimeter.</i>

754
00:56:50,714 --> 00:56:52,982
Colonel Blake, sir.

755
00:56:52,984 --> 00:56:55,351
<i>Black-Dog-Six-Actual, we have
eyes on targets Alpha and Bravo.</i>

756
00:56:55,353 --> 00:56:58,420
Roger that. Get in
position to box them in.

757
00:56:58,422 --> 00:57:00,022
<i>Roger, Six-Actual.</i>

758
00:57:00,024 --> 00:57:01,924
<i>Targets are eight klicks out
and moving fast.</i>

759
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:03,528
George is with the wolf?

760
00:57:05,162 --> 00:57:06,729
You've engaged the
gorilla, sir?

761
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:08,696
And the wolf.

762
00:57:08,698 --> 00:57:11,000
Got them surrounded in a quarry
about 30 miles outside Chicago.

763
00:57:11,002 --> 00:57:14,537
Their trajectories had them both going
in a straight line to the city.

764
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:17,038
Two different species making a
coordinated long-distance journey.

765
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,439
That just doesn't happen.

766
00:57:18,441 --> 00:57:19,607
Excuse me. Who is this?

767
00:57:19,609 --> 00:57:21,544
Colonel, this is Davis Okoye.

768
00:57:21,546 --> 00:57:24,046
He's a primatologist.
He raised the gorilla there.

769
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:26,881
And that is Dr. Caldwell.
She worked for Energyne.

770
00:57:26,883 --> 00:57:29,118
She helped cook up
our cuddly little friends.

771
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,053
Agent Russell, this is a
military operation.

772
00:57:31,055 --> 00:57:34,723
Yes, sir. I understand that, sir.
But right now,

773
00:57:34,725 --> 00:57:37,959
these two know more about these
creatures than anyone on this planet.

774
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:40,796
I think you need to hear
what they have to say.

775
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:43,098
<i>Colonel, what everybody
has to understand is</i>

776
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,600
this is no longer just a wolf
and a gorilla.

777
00:57:45,602 --> 00:57:47,803
A wolf and a gorilla would
be attacking each other.

778
00:57:47,805 --> 00:57:50,939
They wouldn't be traveling in a
straight line to the same destination.

779
00:57:50,941 --> 00:57:53,042
Then what are they doing and
why are they going to Chicago?

780
00:57:53,044 --> 00:57:55,044
Because they're being called.

781
00:57:55,046 --> 00:57:57,879
When I was at Energyne,
we worked with bat DNA.

782
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:01,251
The Wydens were obsessed with
developing biosonar communication,

783
00:58:01,253 --> 00:58:03,886
<i>and it looks like they got it
to work.</i>

784
00:58:03,888 --> 00:58:07,324
Energyne must be emitting some
kind of signal to draw them there.

785
00:58:07,326 --> 00:58:09,991
Those creatures will do
anything

786
00:58:09,993 --> 00:58:13,428
to get to that signal and
make it stop.

787
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,798
Colonel, you have to
evacuate Chicago.

788
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,799
These creatures are engineered
to regenerate.

789
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:19,468
<i>Bullets and tanks
are not gonna stop them.</i>

790
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,275
We have our contingencies
in order, Mr. Okoye.

791
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:24,475
Colonel.

792
00:58:28,178 --> 00:58:31,913
In the meantime, the FBI has
requested that you remain here.

793
00:58:31,915 --> 00:58:34,116
They have a few questions
of their own.

794
00:58:34,118 --> 00:58:35,618
These gentlemen will
see you out.

795
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,821
- Ma'am, let's go.
- Come on.

796
00:58:38,257 --> 00:58:39,754
You're making a big
mistake, Colonel.

797
00:58:39,756 --> 00:58:42,191
Sir, let's go.

798
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:44,859
<i>Targets in circle. All
Bushmasters, targets in three kill zone.</i>

799
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:46,861
<i>Hold fire till playtime.</i>

800
00:58:46,863 --> 00:58:49,266
<i>Black-Dog-Six-Actual, we
have the targets surrounded.</i>

801
00:58:49,268 --> 00:58:52,335
<i>Ambush is set.
All Bushmasters standing by.</i>

802
00:58:52,337 --> 00:58:53,705
Prepare to engage.

803
00:58:58,642 --> 00:59:02,214
This operation is gonna go south fast.
We have to get to Chicago.

804
00:59:04,147 --> 00:59:06,649
Yeah, I'm working on it.

805
00:59:06,651 --> 00:59:09,017
All right, you two. We're in
the transport to the left.

806
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:11,188
- Kate, come on, come on.
- Hey! Hey!

807
00:59:11,955 --> 00:59:13,389
Hey, I said left.

808
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:14,990
Okay. Hold on a second, boys.

809
00:59:14,992 --> 00:59:17,125
You look like very smart MPs.

810
00:59:17,127 --> 00:59:19,627
You also know there's a lot of bad
shit that's going on right now.

811
00:59:19,629 --> 00:59:21,230
And I gotta be honest with
you both,

812
00:59:21,232 --> 00:59:24,033
this stuff that we're doing?
It's not working for me.

813
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:25,834
- Enough. Move!
- Okay, all right.

814
00:59:25,836 --> 00:59:27,304
Just consider this.

815
00:59:27,306 --> 00:59:29,470
I'm a former team guy.
Let's not do this thing,

816
00:59:29,472 --> 00:59:31,540
where you get in my face,
you threaten me,

817
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:33,508
because I'm gonna have
to knock you out,

818
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,378
and then, you, look at me. I'm
gonna choke you out so bad,

819
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,213
you're gonna urinate yourself,
and in front of the lady.

820
00:59:38,215 --> 00:59:40,515
- It's not a good look.
- It wasn't a goddamn request!

821
00:59:40,517 --> 00:59:42,186
- Let's go!
- Hey!

822
00:59:47,992 --> 00:59:50,892
This is exactly what I
didn't want to happen.

823
00:59:50,894 --> 00:59:53,162
That's a big arm.
Don't fight it.

824
00:59:53,164 --> 00:59:55,064
Don't fight it.

825
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:57,435
There you go. Sleepy time.

826
01:00:01,906 --> 01:00:03,738
That's the plan you
were working on?

827
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,874
Well, I didn't kill them.

828
01:00:11,515 --> 01:00:13,115
So what are we looking for?

829
01:00:13,117 --> 01:00:15,116
<i>We're looking
for a helicopter,</i>

830
01:00:15,118 --> 01:00:17,086
<i>but preferably one that's not
surrounded by military personnel.</i>

831
01:00:17,088 --> 01:00:19,591
They probably have a grounded
medevac chopper at the hospital.

832
01:00:23,395 --> 01:00:25,430
And that's why you always
bring a doctor.

833
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:52,557
Good job, Doc.

834
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,662
<i>Well, well, well, looky here.</i>

835
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:02,964
Stealing the hospital
whirlybird.

836
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:04,799
Color me impressed.

837
01:01:04,801 --> 01:01:07,102
That is creative.

838
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:09,271
Come on. You already saw
what George did to our plane.

839
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:11,774
You know everyone's
underestimating these animals.

840
01:01:11,776 --> 01:01:13,776
But you two have the magic
bullet?

841
01:01:13,778 --> 01:01:15,144
We think we know
where to find it.

842
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:17,313
Listen,

843
01:01:17,315 --> 01:01:19,448
Claire Wyden is way too smart to
create a weapon she can't control.

844
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:22,817
They must have an antidote at
Energyne that can halt the mutations.

845
01:01:22,819 --> 01:01:25,120
If we get our hands on it,
it could be our only shot

846
01:01:25,122 --> 01:01:27,492
to stop George and the wolf
before they level Chicago.

847
01:01:32,662 --> 01:01:35,163
You know, this ain't
no truck stop, <i>amigo.</i>

848
01:01:35,165 --> 01:01:37,602
They don't just leave keys
under the visor.

849
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:40,935
Wait, you're helping us?

850
01:01:40,937 --> 01:01:44,705
You saved my life. I reckon
it's the least I can do.

851
01:01:44,707 --> 01:01:46,774
<i>We're on the same page
when it comes to the Wydens.</i>

852
01:01:46,776 --> 01:01:49,877
They think they're
above the law.

853
01:01:49,879 --> 01:01:51,946
And I wanna remind them
that they ain't.

854
01:01:51,948 --> 01:01:55,616
So yes, we are helping
each other.

855
01:01:55,618 --> 01:01:56,854
Do what you do.

856
01:01:58,122 --> 01:01:59,524
I'll be in touch.

857
01:02:00,624 --> 01:02:02,024
<i>Wow.</i>

858
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:04,058
That went way better
than I thought it would.

859
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,127
Yeah, it did. I was hoping I could
knock him out, too, though.

860
01:02:06,129 --> 01:02:08,663
You know there are other ways
of dealing with people, right?

861
01:02:08,665 --> 01:02:10,801
I do know that, yeah, but
that's no fun.

862
01:02:13,337 --> 01:02:14,905
I assume you know how to
fly this thing.

863
01:02:17,409 --> 01:02:18,810
Absolutely.

864
01:02:24,682 --> 01:02:26,482
It's coming back to me.

865
01:02:26,484 --> 01:02:28,819
It's all coming back,
right now.

866
01:02:30,322 --> 01:02:32,053
Yeah.

867
01:02:32,055 --> 01:02:37,024
It's coming back.
It's coming back.

868
01:02:37,026 --> 01:02:40,928
<i>Sir, we are 15 minutes from
sunrise. Call for fire to follow, over.</i>

869
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:43,971
<i>We have the targets.
Serpents are in position. It's playtime.</i>

870
01:02:45,669 --> 01:02:48,102
Get the FLIR footage onscreen.

871
01:02:48,104 --> 01:02:50,206
<i>FLIR is up.</i>

872
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,173
<i>This is Three-Six.
Targets in the open, over.</i>

873
01:02:51,175 --> 01:02:52,342
Clear to fire.

874
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:53,745
<i>Shot out.</i>

875
01:02:59,883 --> 01:03:02,450
<i>Good hit. Stand by for BDA.</i>

876
01:03:02,452 --> 01:03:04,019
Confirm EKIA.

877
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:06,555
<i>Six-Alpha-Lobo X-ray.
Confirm EKIA. Over.</i>

878
01:03:06,557 --> 01:03:08,457
<i>Roger, Lobo. Stand by.</i>

879
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:10,228
Two-six, stay on overwatch.

880
01:03:11,928 --> 01:03:14,598
Echo-Zero-two,
moving to phase line gold.

881
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:17,266
Jesus!

882
01:03:17,268 --> 01:03:20,134
Come on, come on.

883
01:03:20,136 --> 01:03:22,638
<i>Six-Alpha-Lobo X-ray.
Sitrep, over.</i>

884
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,373
Negative EKIA.

885
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:27,475
They must have moved, sir.
I say again, we no longer...

886
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,080
Jesus Christ!

887
01:03:32,082 --> 01:03:34,253
<i>They're on our east and west flanks!
Everybody move!</i>

888
01:03:38,322 --> 01:03:39,424
<i>Nothing's working!</i>

889
01:03:42,459 --> 01:03:45,730
Bushmaster-Six-Alpha, this is Lobo X-ray.
Need a sitrep, over.

890
01:03:46,597 --> 01:03:47,799
Captain Evans?

891
01:03:53,604 --> 01:03:57,171
Kaplan, inform the National Guard we're
moving forward with the contingency plan.

892
01:03:57,173 --> 01:03:59,174
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

893
01:03:59,176 --> 01:04:01,642
I want ground artillery rolling
into downtown Chicago, ASAP!

894
01:04:01,644 --> 01:04:03,678
This time, we throw everything
we can at these things,

895
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,080
and get people the hell out
of that city!

896
01:04:06,082 --> 01:04:08,816
<i>I want blockades at every
quarter mile south of the Loop!</i>

897
01:04:08,818 --> 01:04:10,852
<i>We evacuate
civilians to the north!</i>

898
01:04:10,854 --> 01:04:14,257
It's me. They are
evacuating Chicago.

899
01:04:14,259 --> 01:04:16,857
<i>George and the wolf went
right through Blake's men.</i>

900
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:19,627
<i>Okoye, they are out in
front of you.</i>

901
01:04:19,629 --> 01:04:20,765
Copy that.

902
01:04:24,968 --> 01:04:27,035
What is it?

903
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:29,278
They're never gonna get everyone
out of the city in time.

904
01:05:01,206 --> 01:05:02,341
Davis!

905
01:05:21,557 --> 01:05:23,091
<i>Two-Three,
targets in the open.</i>

906
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,926
<i>Roger. You are clear and hot.</i>

907
01:05:24,928 --> 01:05:27,662
<i>Roger. Weapons free.
I'm engaging now.</i>

908
01:05:27,664 --> 01:05:29,364
<i>Jesus!
I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

909
01:05:29,366 --> 01:05:31,066
<i>Bird down! Bird down!</i>

910
01:05:31,068 --> 01:05:33,269
<i>To hell with that,
I'm taking these things out.</i>

911
01:05:33,504 --> 01:05:35,006
<i>I have no control!</i>

912
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,867
<i>Two-Nine firing, target hit.
Lighting him up.</i>

913
01:05:50,953 --> 01:05:52,453
<i>He hit me with something!</i>

914
01:05:52,455 --> 01:05:53,754
<i>Lost tail rudders!</i>

915
01:05:53,756 --> 01:05:55,760
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
I'm going down!</i>

916
01:06:02,598 --> 01:06:04,899
Status report.
Where is Warthog One?

917
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:07,134
Inbound, sir.

918
01:06:07,136 --> 01:06:09,977
<i>- Warthog One, you are cleared hot.
- Roger that.</i>

919
01:06:16,613 --> 01:06:18,448
<i>This is Warthog One.
Targets missed.</i>

920
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:23,752
<i>Lobo X-ray, request come
back around for another run.</i>

921
01:06:23,754 --> 01:06:26,955
Warthog One, this is Black-Dog-Six-Actual.
Hit them again.

922
01:06:26,957 --> 01:06:28,391
<i>Roger that.</i>

923
01:06:28,393 --> 01:06:29,957
Kaplan, where are we
with the evacuation?

924
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:32,395
50% downtown, sir.

925
01:06:32,397 --> 01:06:35,497
Sir, we have a bogey headed north
in the river, half mile out.

926
01:06:35,499 --> 01:06:37,402
What the hell are you
talking about?

927
01:06:44,107 --> 01:06:45,340
Is that a ship?

928
01:06:45,342 --> 01:06:46,841
It's underwater, sir.

929
01:06:46,843 --> 01:06:49,179
We don't have any subs
in the area.

930
01:07:06,763 --> 01:07:09,099
Davis, there's something big
in the river.

931
01:07:38,995 --> 01:07:40,731
Well, that sucks.

932
01:07:42,064 --> 01:07:43,732
<i>This is Three-Two.</i>

933
01:07:43,734 --> 01:07:45,167
<i>We have enemy contact in the river!
How copy?</i>

934
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:46,901
<i>Say again, Three-Two?</i>

935
01:07:46,903 --> 01:07:48,703
<i>Enemy contact!
Target is heading east!</i>

936
01:07:48,705 --> 01:07:50,471
<i>Copy, Three-Two.
Call for fire to follow.</i>

937
01:07:50,473 --> 01:07:51,872
1 <i>Negative, negative!
Danger close!</i>

938
01:07:51,874 --> 01:07:53,140
<i>Copy, Three-Two.</i>

939
01:07:53,142 --> 01:07:55,912
Direct all forces at that
thing now!

940
01:07:57,548 --> 01:08:00,515
<i>Enemy contact!
Three o'clock! Engage!</i>

941
01:08:00,517 --> 01:08:02,384
Flank him!

942
01:08:02,386 --> 01:08:03,651
Everything you've got!

943
01:08:03,653 --> 01:08:05,020
Aim for the gills!

944
01:08:05,022 --> 01:08:06,325
Fire!

945
01:08:31,547 --> 01:08:33,252
Fire! Fire! Fire!

946
01:08:51,802 --> 01:08:53,202
<i>They can't stop them.</i>

947
01:08:53,204 --> 01:08:54,872
We gotta get that antidote.

948
01:09:11,555 --> 01:09:13,322
<i>Alpha-Six-Actual,
we can't hold them!</i>

949
01:09:13,324 --> 01:09:14,956
<i>I've lost half my men!
We're backing out!</i>

950
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:16,925
Are we evacuated downtown?

951
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,261
Clear at a 10-block radius from
Upper Wacker to Adams, sir.

952
01:09:19,263 --> 01:09:20,728
Prep the MOABs.

953
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:21,932
Roger that.

954
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:35,109
Colonel, you are about to drop the largest
conventional bomb in the arsenal,

955
01:09:35,111 --> 01:09:37,144
on US soil.

956
01:09:37,146 --> 01:09:40,447
With all due respect, sir, there
has got to be another way.

957
01:09:40,449 --> 01:09:42,251
You drop that bomb,

958
01:09:42,253 --> 01:09:45,687
not only do you wipe out
half a city,

959
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:47,755
but you'd destroy any
evidence.

960
01:09:47,757 --> 01:09:50,759
See, I got a team on the way to
Energyne to secure the antidote.

961
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:55,331
So if you could divert some
resources and support them...

962
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:58,465
Is this the same team that
stole my medevac chopper?

963
01:09:58,467 --> 01:10:00,202
Davis Okoye
and Dr. Caldwell...

964
01:10:00,204 --> 01:10:02,270
Need to get the hell
out of there.

965
01:10:02,272 --> 01:10:05,105
And I need you to drop
the cowboy bullshit,

966
01:10:05,107 --> 01:10:06,811
and get with the program.

967
01:10:10,113 --> 01:10:11,845
Well, sir,

968
01:10:11,847 --> 01:10:13,848
you know us cowboys.

969
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:17,551
We just can't stand
leaving our friends behind.

970
01:10:17,553 --> 01:10:20,288
Get your ass out of here!

971
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:24,028
Finally, an order of yours
I can agree with.

972
01:10:29,699 --> 01:10:31,735
Let's bring up a feed
on our stealth bombers.

973
01:10:34,471 --> 01:10:37,037
Bomber feed is up.

974
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:40,376
<i>Viper Two-Five, you've been
released for mission execution, time now.</i>

975
01:10:40,378 --> 01:10:42,411
<i>Holding
short, runway two-five.</i>

976
01:10:42,413 --> 01:10:44,246
<i>Cleared for
take-off, runway two-five.</i>

977
01:10:44,248 --> 01:10:45,880
<i>Cleared for take-off,
two-five.</i>

978
01:10:45,882 --> 01:10:48,515
<i>Roger. Good luck.</i>

979
01:10:48,517 --> 01:10:51,386
<i>Lobo X-ray, this is
Viper Two-Five.</i>

980
01:10:51,388 --> 01:10:53,421
<i>Package is airborne.</i>

981
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:56,523
<i>We are inbound.</i>

982
01:10:56,525 --> 01:10:59,426
Agent Russell, here's the
information you requested.

983
01:10:59,428 --> 01:11:02,197
That's the FBI's list
for Energyne's servers.

984
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:03,665
You were right.

985
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:05,666
There's one server that
they left off.

986
01:11:05,668 --> 01:11:07,771
And there's only two people
that have access to it.

987
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:14,243
Brett and Claire,
you sneaky sons of bitches.

988
01:11:14,245 --> 01:11:16,013
- Thank you, son.
- Yes, sir.

989
01:11:19,882 --> 01:11:22,420
It's Russell. I need a ride.

990
01:11:24,422 --> 01:11:26,691
Come on, this way, this way!
Keep moving!

991
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:36,700
- Where to?
- Eighty-fifth floor.

992
01:11:44,807 --> 01:11:45,943
Lab's in here.

993
01:11:46,776 --> 01:11:48,542
Damn it!

994
01:11:50,248 --> 01:11:51,880
Hey, give me some good news.

995
01:11:51,882 --> 01:11:54,250
MOABs are 30 minutes out,
give or take.

996
01:11:54,252 --> 01:11:56,385
<i>Just one could take out
five city blocks.</i>

997
01:11:56,387 --> 01:11:57,719
<i>You better move!</i>

998
01:11:57,721 --> 01:11:59,720
I'm never taking your
call again.

999
01:11:59,722 --> 01:12:02,090
It's locked. What'd he say?

1000
01:12:02,092 --> 01:12:05,213
Uh, something about the mother of all
bombs is on its way and we need to hurry.

1001
01:12:08,632 --> 01:12:09,900
Okay.

1002
01:12:12,636 --> 01:12:14,169
Jeez!

1003
01:12:14,171 --> 01:12:16,241
FBI must've confiscated
all the hard drives.

1004
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:18,907
All right.

1005
01:12:18,909 --> 01:12:21,246
Come on, Kate, think.

1006
01:12:22,445 --> 01:12:23,680
Here we go.

1007
01:12:26,482 --> 01:12:30,452
Okay, everything in the lab
is on one system.

1008
01:12:30,454 --> 01:12:33,688
The FBI would never have thought
to confiscate a thermostat,

1009
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:35,523
but there's a backdoor into
the server.

1010
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:38,093
So we should be able to access
every file

1011
01:12:38,095 --> 01:12:39,928
from here.

1012
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:42,964
<i>Okay. Change of plan.
The military's lost control.</i>

1013
01:12:42,966 --> 01:12:44,631
We're coming up.

1014
01:12:44,633 --> 01:12:45,966
All right.

1015
01:12:45,968 --> 01:12:48,469
The chopper is ready.

1016
01:12:48,471 --> 01:12:51,473
I have got your rat.

1017
01:12:51,475 --> 01:12:54,975
Let's get the R-19 from the
lab so we have some leverage

1018
01:12:54,977 --> 01:12:57,647
when this shitstorm
finally catches up with us.

1019
01:12:58,481 --> 01:12:59,980
Now what?

1020
01:12:59,982 --> 01:13:01,151
We have visitors.

1021
01:13:03,787 --> 01:13:06,019
- I don't believe this.
- What's wrong?

1022
01:13:06,021 --> 01:13:07,855
The system has been
totally scrubbed.

1023
01:13:07,857 --> 01:13:10,524
They erased everything
connected to the project.

1024
01:13:10,526 --> 01:13:12,394
But it's here.

1025
01:13:12,396 --> 01:13:14,165
We just have to find it.

1026
01:13:14,998 --> 01:13:16,201
In there!

1027
01:13:19,668 --> 01:13:20,970
I got this.

1028
01:13:28,212 --> 01:13:29,512
I like it.

1029
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,813
What are we looking for?

1030
01:13:31,815 --> 01:13:34,014
Anything that starts
with "RPG."

1031
01:13:34,016 --> 01:13:36,151
It'll be in one of these
cryopreserve trays.

1032
01:13:36,153 --> 01:13:37,585
Got it.

1033
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:39,190
RPG, RPG.

1034
01:13:41,658 --> 01:13:43,026
I think I found it.

1035
01:13:52,769 --> 01:13:53,937
This is it.

1036
01:13:55,437 --> 01:13:57,338
Is that the cure?

1037
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,674
Not a cure exactly.

1038
01:13:59,676 --> 01:14:03,010
R-19 doesn't revert them
to their normal size.

1039
01:14:03,012 --> 01:14:05,181
It just overrides
their unchecked aggression.

1040
01:14:08,118 --> 01:14:09,850
Nice to see you, Kate.

1041
01:14:09,852 --> 01:14:11,454
Go to hell, Claire.

1042
01:14:12,955 --> 01:14:16,227
I was so sorry
to hear about your brother.

1043
01:14:24,034 --> 01:14:26,271
Now, why don't you hand
those over?

1044
01:14:39,249 --> 01:14:41,582
All right, let's go.

1045
01:14:41,584 --> 01:14:43,154
That's not happening.

1046
01:14:45,388 --> 01:14:47,158
Can I see that, please?

1047
01:14:54,797 --> 01:14:55,932
Davis.

1048
01:14:59,402 --> 01:15:00,501
That happened.

1049
01:15:00,503 --> 01:15:01,768
Davis.

1050
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,139
Now, let's go.

1051
01:15:04,975 --> 01:15:07,011
- Oh, my God!
- Now.

1052
01:15:17,288 --> 01:15:18,655
They're here.

1053
01:15:49,485 --> 01:15:50,486
Move!

1054
01:15:53,155 --> 01:15:56,356
I was actually starting to worry about how
we were gonna reengineer the pathogen.

1055
01:15:57,328 --> 01:15:59,160
Then you showed up.

1056
01:15:59,162 --> 01:16:01,299
Now, get in unless you wanna
end up like your friend.

1057
01:16:19,548 --> 01:16:21,584
Brett! Get back here!

1058
01:16:32,061 --> 01:16:33,196
No!

1059
01:16:42,038 --> 01:16:43,040
Come on.

1060
01:16:51,881 --> 01:16:53,349
I thought you were dead!

1061
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:54,916
Well, I think she missed
all the vital organs,

1062
01:16:54,918 --> 01:16:56,351
but don't jinx it.

1063
01:16:56,353 --> 01:16:57,919
Now, let's get that
antidote. Come on!

1064
01:16:57,921 --> 01:16:59,455
Davis, wait.

1065
01:17:00,522 --> 01:17:01,958
I have one.

1066
01:17:03,259 --> 01:17:05,193
Okay, new plan.

1067
01:17:05,195 --> 01:17:06,560
We give it to George and maybe he
can help us stop the other two.

1068
01:17:06,562 --> 01:17:07,698
Okay.

1069
01:17:12,901 --> 01:17:15,742
Now, we just have to figure out how
the hell we're gonna give it to him.

1070
01:17:17,574 --> 01:17:18,942
We gotta move!

1071
01:17:25,316 --> 01:17:28,715
You know, I'm actually glad
you're both still alive.

1072
01:17:28,717 --> 01:17:30,084
Now, you can go up there
and distract your friend

1073
01:17:30,086 --> 01:17:31,588
while I get the hell
out of here!

1074
01:17:33,391 --> 01:17:35,426
Or I could kill you both now!

1075
01:17:41,897 --> 01:17:43,132
Okay.

1076
01:17:44,301 --> 01:17:45,735
I'll go.

1077
01:17:49,638 --> 01:17:50,807
George!

1078
01:17:53,008 --> 01:17:55,943
Get away from me!
Get your hands off me!

1079
01:17:55,945 --> 01:17:57,948
What the hell are you doing?

1080
01:17:59,982 --> 01:18:01,784
Feeding the monster to
the gorilla!

1081
01:18:11,694 --> 01:18:13,964
Oh, shit!

1082
01:18:20,337 --> 01:18:21,602
What?

1083
01:18:21,604 --> 01:18:23,804
No, forget my sister!

1084
01:18:23,806 --> 01:18:25,605
She lost her goddamn mind!

1085
01:18:25,607 --> 01:18:28,611
You just get an SUV over here!
You get me out of here now!

1086
01:18:31,047 --> 01:18:32,349
Damn, son!

1087
01:18:34,317 --> 01:18:37,684
Did you just run down
80 flights of stairs?

1088
01:18:37,686 --> 01:18:39,719
Who the hell are you?

1089
01:18:39,721 --> 01:18:42,291
I'm the fella that was gonna run
up those stairs to arrest you.

1090
01:18:42,293 --> 01:18:43,858
But, shit,

1091
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,563
you look so terrible
I feel kind of bad about it.

1092
01:18:50,632 --> 01:18:52,201
I'll tell you what.

1093
01:18:52,203 --> 01:18:55,336
Since you're working so hard
to get out of here,

1094
01:18:55,338 --> 01:18:58,306
I'm guessing you got a laptop
in that bag there.

1095
01:18:58,308 --> 01:19:00,974
You give it to me and you
can just get.

1096
01:19:00,976 --> 01:19:03,010
Right out that door.

1097
01:19:03,012 --> 01:19:05,413
- Really?
- Yeah.

1098
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:07,684
You just hand it over
and be on your way.

1099
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,886
Okay!

1100
01:19:12,888 --> 01:19:14,921
It's really my sister
who did all this.

1101
01:19:14,923 --> 01:19:16,424
This wasn't even my idea.

1102
01:19:16,426 --> 01:19:18,559
Since when is
complicity a crime?

1103
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:20,362
Exactly.

1104
01:19:20,364 --> 01:19:22,996
- See you, Tex!
- Hey!

1105
01:19:22,998 --> 01:19:24,959
Why don't you leave the
little fella here with me?

1106
01:19:26,735 --> 01:19:29,406
That's my pleasure.
I hate that thing!

1107
01:19:39,548 --> 01:19:40,747
Oh.

1108
01:19:40,749 --> 01:19:42,450
Damn.

1109
01:19:42,452 --> 01:19:43,954
That was a lot.

1110
01:19:47,891 --> 01:19:50,191
Boy, I hope y'all have
a plan up there.

1111
01:19:50,193 --> 01:19:53,597
What do you say, little fella?
Let's you and I take another exit.

1112
01:20:13,982 --> 01:20:16,417
When does the antidote
kick in?

1113
01:20:16,419 --> 01:20:18,719
Ten minutes, maybe.

1114
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:20,891
This building is not gonna
be standing in 10 minutes!

1115
01:20:28,463 --> 01:20:30,235
How the hell do we get
off this roof?

1116
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:36,469
Maybe we don't have
to get off the roof at all.

1117
01:20:36,471 --> 01:20:37,473
What?

1118
01:20:41,744 --> 01:20:44,178
No, we definitely do!

1119
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,316
Come on, come on!

1120
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,483
Davis!

1121
01:20:49,485 --> 01:20:51,319
There's no tail on this
helicopter!

1122
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:52,586
That's right. We don't
need one.

1123
01:20:52,588 --> 01:20:54,087
You do, if you wanna fly!

1124
01:20:54,089 --> 01:20:56,257
We're not gonna fly,
we're gonna crash.

1125
01:20:56,259 --> 01:20:57,294
What?

1126
01:21:01,331 --> 01:21:03,630
Okay...

1127
01:21:03,632 --> 01:21:05,765
We just need to get enough lift to stay
on top of the building as it falls.

1128
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:07,436
You know,
just like riding an avalanche.

1129
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:09,705
No, I don't know!

1130
01:21:19,383 --> 01:21:21,118
Come on, baby!
Here we go.

1131
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:39,400
Oh, my God!

1132
01:21:39,402 --> 01:21:40,736
This could get ugly.

1133
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:48,643
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1134
01:21:48,645 --> 01:21:49,646
Oh, Jesus!

1135
01:21:52,348 --> 01:21:54,551
Oh, my God!

1136
01:22:01,658 --> 01:22:03,660
Hold on, Kate!

1137
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,169
Brace!

1138
01:23:00,882 --> 01:23:02,252
I got you.

1139
01:23:13,829 --> 01:23:15,333
I need a drink.

1140
01:23:27,343 --> 01:23:29,346
I can't believe we
survived that.

1141
01:23:32,582 --> 01:23:34,682
Wait, there's still
people here.

1142
01:23:34,684 --> 01:23:36,820
We need to call off the airstrike.
Come on.

1143
01:23:51,368 --> 01:23:52,636
Davis.

1144
01:23:54,204 --> 01:23:55,504
I know.

1145
01:24:02,212 --> 01:24:03,347
George?

1146
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:06,883
You okay?

1147
01:24:19,228 --> 01:24:20,463
Thank God.

1148
01:24:21,963 --> 01:24:23,833
Good to have you back, buddy.

1149
01:24:28,738 --> 01:24:30,374
Oh, I look like shit?

1150
01:24:31,007 --> 01:24:32,373
<i>Okay.</i>

1151
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:35,678
You look like big shit!

1152
01:24:54,663 --> 01:24:55,898
Come on.

1153
01:25:00,869 --> 01:25:03,069
<i>Lobo X-ray, this is
Viper Two-Five.</i>

1154
01:25:03,071 --> 01:25:04,904
<i>Escorts are in position. We are
eight minutes from target.</i>

1155
01:25:04,906 --> 01:25:06,706
<i>Over.</i>

1156
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,210
<i>Roger, Two-Five.
Call for fire to follow.</i>

1157
01:25:08,212 --> 01:25:09,713
<i>- Over.
- Copy that.</i>

1158
01:25:11,513 --> 01:25:13,115
Let's go! Let's go!

1159
01:25:15,117 --> 01:25:16,783
What's the plan?

1160
01:25:16,785 --> 01:25:19,118
I want you to take this Humvee
and find a sat phone.

1161
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,889
And get a hold of Russell. He's our only
shot at calling off this airstrike.

1162
01:25:21,891 --> 01:25:24,791
Then let him know there's still military
personnel and civilians on the ground.

1163
01:25:24,793 --> 01:25:26,293
George and I will handle
the other two.

1164
01:25:26,295 --> 01:25:28,062
- Davis?
- Yeah?

1165
01:25:28,064 --> 01:25:30,401
Try not to get killed, okay?

1166
01:25:31,368 --> 01:25:32,636
Come on, get going.

1167
01:25:42,611 --> 01:25:45,612
All right, George. We gotta stop these
things before they destroy the city.

1168
01:25:47,482 --> 01:25:50,153
That's right.
Let's kick some ass.

1169
01:26:08,671 --> 01:26:09,972
Oh, shit!

1170
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:34,497
Of course the wolf flies.

1171
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,980
Hey!
Come and get me,

1172
01:26:53,982 --> 01:26:55,985
you ugly son of a bitch!

1173
01:27:03,626 --> 01:27:04,628
That's it!

1174
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,916
Help! I need a satellite
phone!

1175
01:27:28,918 --> 01:27:30,584
It's not safe here, ma'am.
We need to go now.

1176
01:27:30,586 --> 01:27:31,852
You two, get her on the truck.

1177
01:27:31,854 --> 01:27:34,654
Wait! There's a way to
stop this!

1178
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,822
Fellas.

1179
01:27:35,824 --> 01:27:37,157
Russell?

1180
01:27:37,159 --> 01:27:39,559
- I will take it from here.
- Yes, sir.

1181
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:41,395
Take a breath, Doc.

1182
01:27:41,397 --> 01:27:42,763
Tell me what you're
doing here.

1183
01:27:42,765 --> 01:27:44,531
The antidote worked.

1184
01:27:44,533 --> 01:27:46,400
Davis and George are trying
to stop the other two.

1185
01:27:46,402 --> 01:27:48,702
But there's still civilians
and military on the ground.

1186
01:27:48,704 --> 01:27:51,074
We have to call off the
airstrike.

1187
01:27:54,443 --> 01:27:57,678
Son, I'll tell you what.
Let's trade.

1188
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,548
- All right, come on. Let's get.
- Hey. Hey!

1189
01:28:07,056 --> 01:28:08,725
George, go!

1190
01:29:25,467 --> 01:29:28,203
Colonel Blake, it is your
old pal, Agent Russell.

1191
01:29:28,205 --> 01:29:29,803
Listen, about your MOABs.

1192
01:29:29,805 --> 01:29:31,839
Do me a favor, would you,

1193
01:29:31,841 --> 01:29:34,974
<i>and take a gander at Federal
Plaza before you drop them?</i>

1194
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:37,111
Bring up the drone feed
on Federal Plaza.

1195
01:29:37,113 --> 01:29:38,214
Yes, sir.

1196
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:43,520
My God.

1197
01:30:41,177 --> 01:30:42,545
Oh, come on.

1198
01:30:59,361 --> 01:31:01,264
George, no!

1199
01:31:04,132 --> 01:31:06,599
<i>This is Viper Two-Five.
Two minutes out.</i>

1200
01:31:06,601 --> 01:31:09,736
<i>Target is locked.
MOABs are armed.</i>

1201
01:31:09,738 --> 01:31:11,106
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

1202
01:31:24,919 --> 01:31:26,586
Run!

1203
01:31:26,588 --> 01:31:28,658
Get up! You gotta move!

1204
01:31:56,118 --> 01:31:57,951
Come on, come on, come on!

1205
01:31:57,953 --> 01:31:59,356
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

1206
01:32:26,316 --> 01:32:28,356
You mess with my friend,
you mess with me, mother...

1207
01:32:43,365 --> 01:32:44,368
Shit!

1208
01:33:56,739 --> 01:33:57,874
George.

1209
01:34:01,311 --> 01:34:02,445
George.

1210
01:34:07,449 --> 01:34:09,219
I'll be damned.

1211
01:34:10,953 --> 01:34:12,255
Abort mission.

1212
01:34:45,654 --> 01:34:46,989
George.

1213
01:34:48,022 --> 01:34:49,426
Hey, buddy.

1214
01:34:58,434 --> 01:34:59,534
We did it.

1215
01:35:02,538 --> 01:35:04,107
We saved the city.

1216
01:35:10,111 --> 01:35:11,214
Yeah.

1217
01:35:12,013 --> 01:35:13,615
You saved me.

1218
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:17,019
George saved Davis.

1219
01:35:51,387 --> 01:35:52,522
George.

1220
01:35:54,356 --> 01:35:55,490
George!

1221
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,942
I'm so sorry, Davis.

1222
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:51,278
He saved my life.

1223
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,282
He saved a lot of
people's lives.

1224
01:37:21,577 --> 01:37:22,578
<i>Mommy!</i>

1225
01:37:34,489 --> 01:37:35,825
Yes, he did.

1226
01:37:46,034 --> 01:37:47,470
Did I just see you close
your eye?

1227
01:37:49,338 --> 01:37:51,172
I just saw you open your eye!

1228
01:37:57,213 --> 01:37:59,380
Son of a bitch!

1229
01:37:59,382 --> 01:38:00,947
Pretending to be dead?

1230
01:38:00,949 --> 01:38:03,287
- At a time like this?
- Oh, my God!

1231
01:38:09,156 --> 01:38:10,523
No, no.

1232
01:38:10,525 --> 01:38:12,524
No, it's not funny
and I wasn't crying!

1233
01:38:12,526 --> 01:38:14,893
I wasn't crying, okay? There's
a lot of debris around here!

1234
01:38:14,895 --> 01:38:16,795
Wait, is this like a thing
between you guys?

1235
01:38:16,797 --> 01:38:18,999
This is not a thing between us.
It's a thing with him!

1236
01:38:19,001 --> 01:38:21,503
Because he has a twisted
sense of humor!

1237
01:38:25,407 --> 01:38:29,210
Yes, I guess you could
say that.

1238
01:38:29,212 --> 01:38:31,844
She is part of my troop.

1239
01:38:31,846 --> 01:38:33,679
I mean, we're friends, right?

1240
01:38:33,681 --> 01:38:35,416
Yeah.

1241
01:38:35,418 --> 01:38:37,321
Yes, we're friends.

1242
01:38:41,189 --> 01:38:42,822
No! Come on, dude!

1243
01:38:42,824 --> 01:38:44,657
Have some class, okay?

1244
01:38:44,659 --> 01:38:47,193
I don't know what's gotten into him.
Kate, I'm so sorry.

1245
01:38:47,195 --> 01:38:48,661
George, stop.

1246
01:38:48,663 --> 01:38:50,095
All right, all right, guys.

1247
01:38:50,097 --> 01:38:51,997
Let's go home, okay?

1248
01:38:51,999 --> 01:38:53,433
Dude, that was funny.

1249
01:38:53,435 --> 01:38:54,733
I heard that!

1250
01:38:54,735 --> 01:38:56,603
Shit.

1251
01:38:56,605 --> 01:38:59,738
Thank you for saving the
world.

1252
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:01,608
Yeah, thanks for calling off
the airstrike.

1253
01:39:01,610 --> 01:39:03,910
Like a wise cowboy
once said,

1254
01:39:03,912 --> 01:39:07,179
us assholes gotta
stick together.

1255
01:39:07,181 --> 01:39:09,216
How about we all help
these people out,

1256
01:39:09,218 --> 01:39:11,351
and then find George
here a new home.

1257
01:39:11,353 --> 01:39:13,886
Where are we gonna put him?

1258
01:39:13,888 --> 01:39:16,956
I can tell you right now, we're
not gonna put him on a plane.

1259
01:39:39,673 --> 01:39:44,678
