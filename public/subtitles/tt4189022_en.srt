1
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:23,491
30 years ago,
I found the book of the dead.

2
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,759
Now because I read from the book...

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,461
Misartar.

4
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,563
Evil has found me.

5
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,534
All roads to destroying this evil

6
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,702
lead to wear it all began.

7
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:36,679
The cabin.

8
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,114
- Let's go back there and end it all.
- You know I'm down.

9
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,475
The sooner this book
is six feet under, the better.

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,711
Yeah!

11
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:44,811
Here's the plan.

12
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,715
- Whoa!
- Shoot first, think never.

13
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,484
Whoa!

14
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,587
That didn't work.

15
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,153
Present the book to me
and we'll finally end this.

16
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:57,758
Ta demuche.

17
00:00:57,783 --> 00:00:58,909
Pablo!

18
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:01,570
You have no idea what you're doing.

19
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,294
Of course I know what I'm doing.

20
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:04,638
I wrote this book.

21
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,538
Your stupid mortal toys
mean nothing to me.

22
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:13,407
Take the deal
then go back to Jacksonville.

23
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:17,178
I am offering you
the undo button you wanted.

24
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:20,514
Normal life in Jacksonville,
the three of us.

25
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,283
- I can do that.
- Truce.

26
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,652
Yeah!

27
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:28,492
Whooo!

28
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:32,138
Jacksonville here we come.

29
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,626
Mamma!

30
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,497
Atar. Artha.

31
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,251
Artica abomino!

32
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,269
I have fought with Atilla the Hun

33
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,671
and Genghis Khan,

34
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,841
And this dipshit is my only hope?

35
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,576
Oh, fuck. What a mess.

36
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,286
Summu Nura.

37
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,488
Ashrica.

38
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,758
Akrem.

39
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,427
Ash...

40
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,416
Jacksonville, I love you!

41
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,917
We love you, Ash!

42
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:37,918
I know you do!

43
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,720
Hey, I love me too!

44
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,591
Ash! Ash! Ash!

45
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,792
Ash! Ash! Ash!

46
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,427
Ash! Ash! Ash!

47
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,595
Ash! Ash! Ash!

48
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:48,962
Ash! Ash! Ash!

49
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,631
Ash! Ash! Ash!

50
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,469
Oh, Jefe.

51
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,406
You know. You don't have to call
him that any more Pablo.

52
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:59,906
'Cause now he's just "water trash,"

53
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,675
like everyone else in this town.

54
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,877
Especially non tippers like you, buddy.

55
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,446
Yeah, thanks.

56
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,714
Hey, come on, Kell,

57
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,981
Ash did what he had to do.

58
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,483
He saved us.

59
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,984
And left Ruby in charge.

60
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,562
You know what, I don't trust that bitch

61
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,172
as far as I can throw her.

62
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:16,266
Kelly, there's someone wanting to pay.

63
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,660
Pull!

64
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,935
Looking good, Eli.

65
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,837
Hey, Sailor.

66
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,507
I had fun last night.

67
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,709
I think I remember that.

68
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,244
This is my daughter, Hannah.

69
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,513
Oh, how nice for you to meet me.

70
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,815
Can I, um, touch it?

71
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,589
My God.

72
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,591
How does it work?

73
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,661
Uh, well, I think it's pretty obvious.

74
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,829
Ladies, I'm gonna be honest with ya,

75
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:59,667
I'm not drunk enough to know if
this is good-weird or bad-weird.

76
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,001
But I'll get there though.

77
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,549
Fu..

78
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,818
Whoa!

79
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,996
Oh, shit!

80
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,006
My God...

81
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,443
I left the windows down in the Delta.

82
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,977
Whoa!

83
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,015
Hey, hey! Time out!

84
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,870
You're not supposed to be here.

85
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,088
Didn't you get the memo?

86
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,456
- There's a truce!
- Talk to Ruby.

87
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,493
She sent us!

88
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,796
Balls to the wall!

89
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,673
Your truce is over, Ashy Slashy!

90
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:15,808
What'd you call me?

91
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,512
<i>Ashy Slashy, hatchet and saw</i>

92
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:23,216
<i>Takes your head and skins you raw</i>

93
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,619
<i>Ashy Slashy, heaven and hell</i>

94
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,556
<i>Cuts out your tongue
so you can't yell...</i>

95
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,699
What the fuck is that?!

96
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,534
Shoot it in the head!

97
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,905
Nooo!

98
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,261
Jefe!

99
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,896
Your blade!

100
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,279
Ugh.

101
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,513
Huh?

102
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,849
Oh!

103
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,685
Give me your eyes!

104
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,756
Don't you want to fuck me now?!

105
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,264
Huh.

106
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,673
Get her off me!

107
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,411
I think we're good, Kell!

108
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:02,904
Fucking skank!

109
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,585
You will die like all the others!

110
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,121
One by one, we will take you!

111
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,922
All of you!

112
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,727
Ladies first.

114
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,504
Well, I guess it's safe to say,
the truce is over.

115
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,073
Told you Ruby couldn't be trusted.

116
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,550
We've got to put our little
thinking caps on

117
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,942
and do something...

118
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,677
Yes! You know I'm in.

119
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,113
I have been waiting to kick her ass.

120
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,248
Yeah, amen to that.

121
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,051
But how, Ruby could be anywhere?

122
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,222
I know where she is...

123
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,959
Ruby is in Elk Grove, Michigan.

124
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,061
That's my hometown.

125
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,662
Okay, that's a very specific guess.

126
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,566
The Deadite gave it away with that song.

127
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,634
That damn song...

128
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,270
Alright.

129
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,072
We're gonna go to Elk Grove.

130
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,105
We're gonna find Ruby

131
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,141
and I'm going to bury
that Kandarian Dagger

132
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,077
deep into her strangely beautiful neck

133
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,678
and kill her where she stands.

134
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,081
We'll be back in Jacksonville by Friday.

135
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,983
Pablo, first round
of 'Ritas is on you, because...

136
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,986
Oh, because it's the drink of my people.

137
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,687
That's a little racist, don't you think?

138
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,292
Well, yeah.

139
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,278
Sinkholes are still being reported.

140
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,380
And look at this, Kenward County.

141
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,016
Violent crime and murder up 200%

142
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,784
from this time last year.

143
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,088
Yeah, Ruby's evil is seeping everywhere.

144
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:24,481
Alright. We need a sketch of her
to show the people in town.

145
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,234
- Pablo?
- I'm on it.

146
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,506
So, uh, why so long since
you've been home?

147
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:34,290
Oh, who drank all the beer?

148
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:35,243
I got it.

149
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,303
Um, you.

150
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,314
Your bladder must be ready to explode.

151
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,803
Oh, please,

152
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:42,964
I've been whizzing the whole time.

153
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,382
Ugh!

154
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,386
Ugh!

155
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:00,153
_

156
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,733
Do it! I dare you.

157
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,769
- You do it.
- Chicken.

158
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,071
- Don't say that.
- Run!

159
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,574
Ashy Slashy's coming to get you!

160
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,279
You think Ruby's here?!

161
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,780
In a crack house?

162
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,184
No, this is my house.

163
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:27,039
Or at least it used to be.

164
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:31,224
Oh, it's, it's...

165
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,558
nice.

166
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,859
Your parents still live here?

167
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,429
My parents died a long time ago.

168
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,532
Just um, give me a sec.

169
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,944
I've never seen
the Jefe like this before.

170
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,274
Whatever happened in this town

171
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,476
seems to really haunt him.

172
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,545
Look at this creepy fucker.

173
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,214
Where?

174
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,148
He was right...

175
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:00,641
dude, he was right there.

176
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:03,356
Oh, shit!

177
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,325
Asshole.

178
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,372
Oh!

179
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:48,458
You come here to rob me, punk?

180
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:49,918
Think I won't fight back?

181
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,277
I'm not robbing you.

182
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,541
Ashley?

183
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,103
Hello Dad.

184
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,665
Been a long time.

185
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,548
You look...

186
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,393
Old.

187
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:08,657
- Bloated. Like a sack of...
- Yeah, I get the idea.

188
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:09,867
How you been, pop?

189
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:11,902
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

190
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:13,929
Can't a guy come and see his own father?

191
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:17,347
What the hell is that?

192
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:19,769
Oh, it's um, a utility hand.

193
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:21,011
A friend made it for me.

194
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:23,323
Check it out. I'm better, stronger...

195
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:24,403
- Faster?
- Yeah!

196
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,884
Bullshit. Looks like some
piece of crap made in China.

197
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:28,004
What was that gun shot?!

198
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,840
Alright, put down the guns!

199
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:32,340
- What is going on?
- You got a green card kid?

200
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:35,217
Kelly, Pablo, meet my father.

201
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,295
Whoa. Filthy and fine.

202
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,579
Brock Williams.

203
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:41,384
But you can call me Cock.

204
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:43,047
He's your father alright.

205
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,227
Um, I thought you said
your Dad was dead.

206
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:48,609
Dead? He's the one that died. Not me.

207
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,930
Uh, we were sort of dead to each other.

208
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,250
What have you done now?

209
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,051
Nothing. We're just looking for someone.

210
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:55,310
Pablo...

211
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,884
I drew most of it while
the car was moving, but...

212
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:02,059
What? You're looking for Bigfoot?

213
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,826
It was a bumpy ride!

214
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:05,075
Okay, you know what? Forget it.

215
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,310
You don't want to help, that's fine.

216
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:07,957
Some things never change.

217
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:09,423
Oh, still the victim with you, huh.

218
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:11,293
Always somebody else's fault.

219
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,128
Somebody else made you go to that cabin.

220
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,862
Somebody else chopped your hand off...

221
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,942
- Ah, no, I did that.
- Somebody else killed your girl.

222
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:18,245
No, I did that too.

223
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,502
Come on, Dad, you know
exactly what happened.

224
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:22,251
Why didn't you set
those people straight?

225
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:23,791
Because you should have.

226
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:25,407
Instead you let 'em beat you down

227
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,559
and you ran away with
your tail between your legs.

228
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:29,486
Thank God your mother
wasn't here to see that.

229
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:31,413
I did what I had to do.

230
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:34,781
Ashley, it's taken me a long time

231
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:36,564
to get my life back together.

232
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:41,688
I think it's best that you and
the "illegal" here just leave.

233
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,301
Kelly, would you like
to have dinner with me?

234
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,328
That's a hard pass.

235
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:49,364
Get out.

236
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:54,657
Let's go.

237
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:22,737
Elk Grove.

238
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,616
Hasn't changed a bit.

239
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:26,034
What's the plan?

240
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,411
We split up. Ask around.

241
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:28,537
You!

242
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,625
You ruined my life.

243
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,041
I've ruined a lot of people's lives.

244
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:38,791
Here, man. I've got some change.

245
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,201
_

246
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:48,372
How... what the...

247
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:51,583
How did...

248
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,263
Thanks.

249
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,294
Okay, let's go.

250
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,755
Jacksonville's waiting.

251
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:14,040
Whoa, Ash Williams.

252
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:20,644
Ash?

253
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,477
Ash Williams, is that you?

254
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:24,890
Linda Bates!

255
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:27,446
Holy hell... Wow.

256
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:29,749
It's been so long.

257
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,686
You look great in that waitress get-up.

258
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:33,087
Probably even better out of it.

259
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:34,445
Same Ash.

260
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,698
All okay here?

261
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,365
Yeah.

262
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:39,119
Little Tommy Emery?!

263
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,120
It's Sheriff Emery now.

264
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:42,596
And I'm all grown up.

265
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:43,674
You can ask around.

266
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:44,979
Oh.

267
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:48,100
Oh, you...

268
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:51,078
- No! You married Safety Boy?
- Who?

269
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:53,578
That's what we called him
back when he was a Hall Monitor.

270
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,869
Remember the time you peed your pants
outside the locker room?

271
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:57,346
Because you were leaning on the door.

272
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,023
- Guilty.
- Hey, that was such a long time ago.

273
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:01,913
- Right, honey?
- No.

274
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:03,523
Can you give us a second?

275
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:04,649
Sure.

276
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,064
Mm, mm, mm...

277
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,159
Hey.

278
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:10,379
Hey!

279
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:12,565
You've got some huge balls

280
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,251
showing your face in this town.

281
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:15,677
Yeah, I do.

282
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:17,512
Notice I never wear gym shorts.

283
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:19,548
I'm here on business,
looking for a woman.

284
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:20,715
She's bad news.

285
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:21,916
If I don't find her,

286
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:23,894
you might actually have
something to do around here.

287
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,854
Well then, let's find her for you.

288
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:29,999
Everyone, this is Ash.

289
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:32,639
Some of you may know him as Ashy Slashy,

290
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:35,061
because he went crazy
and chopped up his friends.

291
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,530
Okay, that's not true.

292
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:38,334
I did not go crazy.

293
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,813
I knew exactly what I was doing

294
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:41,657
when I chopped up my friends.

295
00:17:41,923 --> 00:17:45,740
And now, Ashy Slashy is back in town

296
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,576
looking for a new woman.

297
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:49,415
So, what do people think?

298
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,180
Should we help Ash find another victim?

299
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,621
Or should we kick him back

300
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,739
to whatever rock he was hiding under?

301
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:57,386
Fuck this sicko! He's got to go!

302
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,011
Yeah! Get him out!

303
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,276
Ashy Slashy!

304
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:03,758
Ashy Slashy! Ashy Slashy!

305
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:08,645
Ashy Slashy! Ashy Slashy! Ashy Slashy!

306
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,518
Ashy Slashy!

307
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:11,770
No.

308
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:14,628
No more running away.

309
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,874
Alright. Get the gum out
of your ears and listen up,

310
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,448
you inbred, degenerate screw heads...

311
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,677
except you Linda.

312
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:24,579
You're so not like them.

313
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,583
Yes, I am Ashy Slashy,

314
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:31,353
the Boomstick Butcher
with the Chainsaw Hand.

315
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:33,588
But you nimrods got me all wrong...

316
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:36,525
I'm here to save this town,
to save my town,

317
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,360
whether you like it or not.

318
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,562
Now I'm here looking for somebody.

319
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:44,799
Check it out.

320
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:46,568
She goes by the name of Ruby.

321
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,137
Anybody?

322
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:50,505
You use your chainsaw to draw that?

323
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:54,509
Time to leave, Ash.

324
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,378
Oh, I'm gonna leave alright.

325
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:58,147
And don't you worry,

326
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,149
after I save all your sorry asses,

327
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:03,746
you won't see me again
for another thirty years dicksticks!

328
00:19:03,771 --> 00:19:05,587
- Loser!
- Yeah!

329
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:00,909
Ugh!

330
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,829
Nooooo!

331
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,857
Hey! Hey!

332
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:17,730
Take it easy.

333
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:19,847
Pablo?

334
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,273
What's wrong?

335
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:24,333
I just saw Ruby.

336
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,434
- Saw Ruby? Where?
- I don't know.

337
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:27,836
I just had a weird vision of her

338
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:31,240
in front of a big brick building.

339
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,908
There were uh, these
smoke stacks there...

340
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:35,310
Two big smoke stacks?

341
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,711
Yeah.

342
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,914
That sounds like the crematorium...

343
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,757
This is it.

344
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:51,245
I saw it so clearly.

345
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,695
Pablo, how long you
been having these visions?

346
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,298
Ever since Ruby put that book on my face

347
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,253
I've been having... nightmares.

348
00:20:58,278 --> 00:20:59,701
But they happen while I'm awake.

349
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,011
How come you never said something?

350
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:03,872
I was afraid.

351
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,308
I don't know what's
happening to me, Jefe.

352
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:09,311
Lets go get some answers.

353
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,964
We gave peace a chance.

354
00:21:30,064 --> 00:21:32,301
Now it's time for war.

355
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,530
Alright, you two go that way.

356
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,000
But remember, these weapons
are only gonna stun Ruby.

357
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,902
So use them to
knock her down or whatever.

358
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:01,004
Then before she heals...

359
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:03,573
I'm gonna put an end to this
horse pucky once and for all.

360
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,451
Oh, god!

361
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:10,072
Ruby!

362
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:12,142
I know you're out there!

363
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:25,026
Hey!

364
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:27,307
Creepy kid?

365
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:28,471
You grew up quick!

366
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:30,440
You should not have come back, Ashley.

367
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:37,936
Ugh.

368
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:44,874
Ash!?

369
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:47,079
- Ash?
- It's that way.

370
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:48,774
- Ah!
- Kelly!

371
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:50,209
Kelly!

372
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:52,809
Kell!

373
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:11,803
Kelly!

374
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:41,072
Yeah, that's it!

375
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,274
Run home and cry to Mamma!

376
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,076
You tell her Ashley J Williams

377
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:46,588
is looking for her.

378
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:47,849
Huh!

379
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,941
Oh...

380
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:54,077
Why you...

381
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,650
My goodness.

382
00:25:57,273 --> 00:26:01,640
Kelly, you're stronger than Ash.

383
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:05,975
Why follow when you should lead.

384
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,201
Ah!

385
00:26:12,355 --> 00:26:14,357

Fuck!

00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:02,783
Help!

398
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:04,497
Ash!

399
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,233
Ash.

400
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,387
Ash.

401
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:31,334
Ash?

402
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,214
You actually found me.

403
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:35,682
Don't be so surprised you know.

404
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:38,665
I do have my moments like this one.

405
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,075
- Hey.
- You broke our truce, why?

406
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,902
I had no option.

407
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,323
I had to summon you...

408
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:46,386
What? So you can sic your
creepy ass kids on me?

409
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:47,786
No.

410
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:50,922
My children have turned on me.
I have lost control of them.

411
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,307
They want the Necronomicon.
They're trying to destroy me.

412
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:55,205
Poor Ruby.

413
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,401
Yeah, welcome to my world, sweet cheeks.

414
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,830
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

415
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:00,898
At least you still have
all your appendages!

416
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:02,099
Now Ash...

417
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:04,101
I need your help...

418
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:05,315
Oh.

419
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,742
Oh, you need my help?

420
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:07,872
Okay, first of all,

421
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:10,192
screw you and your ugly ass kids.

422
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:11,217
Here's what, I need.

423
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:12,910
I need to be back in Jacksonville

424
00:28:12,935 --> 00:28:14,253
on my second keg of beer,

425
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,198
putting my spicy man meat into
a mother-daughter sandwich,

426
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:18,357
that's what I need.

427
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:20,836
As unappetizing as that sounds,

428
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:22,887
you can still have all of that.

429
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:24,196
Just trust me.

430
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:26,891
Help me stop my childre...

431
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:27,967
Hey!

432
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:29,861
I wasn't done with her!

433
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:33,299
Help!

434
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:35,867
Help!

435
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:38,010
Pablo help!

436
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:02,955
Mamma.

437
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,268
Three creepy kids.

438
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:13,170
Well, Ruby's a big girl.

439
00:29:13,195 --> 00:29:15,230
I'm sure she can handle herself.

440
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,351
Gah!

441
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:29,828
Where is the Necronomicon?

442
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,555
What have you done with it?

443
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:33,290
I'll never tell you.

444
00:29:40,097 --> 00:29:42,333
Oh, those damn radar eyes.

445
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:45,049
Do I save her 'cause I should?

446
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:47,138
Or cause she's hot?

447
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:50,995
Mamma.

448
00:29:53,144 --> 00:29:55,110
Alright, you naked assholes,

449
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:57,270
time to pick on someone your own size.

450
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:10,578
You want some?!

451
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:21,580
You feel that? Huh? Do you?

452
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:24,608
You feel that?

453
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,277
Do you?

454
00:30:37,321 --> 00:30:41,644
The Necronomicon says you
are humanity's true savior.

455
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:44,956
This is where your story ends, Jefe!

456
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:02,747
Mom.

457
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:08,242
I'm sorry.

458
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:18,117
Sorry, creepy kid.

459
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,243
Playtime's over.

460
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:20,737
Night-night.

461
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:49,803
I told you you could trust me.

462
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:52,223
- Jefe!?
- Stay the fuck away from him!

463
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:53,530
I got this.

464
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,364
I've made a huge mess.

465
00:31:56,389 --> 00:32:00,042
Yeah, you really fudged
the bowl this time, didn't you?

466
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,871
And now you want me to put
the old rubber gloves on

467
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,303
and help you scrub it clean.

468
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:05,567
Part of me is already
regretting calling you here.

469
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:06,597
Get used to that feeling.

470
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:07,700
- Where's the book?
- Hid it.

471
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:08,958
Go get it.

472
00:32:09,148 --> 00:32:11,828
My children are too
powerful for me alone.

473
00:32:12,262 --> 00:32:14,430
Ash, I need you.

474
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:17,240
All of you, help me retrieve the Book

475
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:19,034
and send them back to Hell.

476
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:20,894
Give me a second.

477
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:22,438
You guys good with that?

478
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:24,161
Huh?

479
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:25,770
Okay.

480
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:26,934
We get the Book.

481
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,610
Send your loser kids back to Hell...

482
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,555
we're back in Jacksonville by Friday.

483
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,783
Pablo, first round of 'Ritas
is on you, because...

484
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:36,186
Ah, yeah, you already used that one.

485
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:37,670
- Really?
- Word-for-word.

486
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:38,696
Wow.

487
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,934
Maybe I'm getting
that bad memory disease.

488
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,380
- Alzheimer's?
- Alzheimer's?!

489
00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:43,708
That's a bad memory disease.

490
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:44,968
Why would you mention that?

491
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:46,995
Focus up, we got work to do!

492
00:32:49,172 --> 00:32:50,462
Let's go save the world.
